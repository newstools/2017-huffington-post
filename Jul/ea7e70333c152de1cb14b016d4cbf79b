Small Business Minister Lindiwe Zulu said on Tuesday she was deeply impressed by the calibre of conversation during the various commissions at the ANC Policy conference. During the ANC's policy conference at Nasrec, Johannesburg, Zulu noted the importance of radical economic transformation, but highlighted that this was not only a task for the ANC but private sector too. She addressed the need to change the face of poverty in South Africa.
