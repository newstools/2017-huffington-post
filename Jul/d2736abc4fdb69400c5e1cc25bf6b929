Sanitary pads should be free and the minimum sentence for violence against women should be between 15 and 20 years. These are some of the recommendations that have come from the African National Congress' sub-committee on social transformation. Addressing the media on the outcomes of commissions at the party's 5th National Policy Conference this week, Human Settlements Minister Lindiwe Sisulu and newly elected Deputy Minister for Women Affairs Buti Manamela agreed that social transformation is an underbelly of South Africa's Freedom Charter. "We are worried about the social fabric of society," Sisulu said. Here are some of the recommendations that the party will take back to its branches ahead of the national conference in December: Sisulu said the party is concerned about social issues such as poverty, xenophobia and incidents of racism. Manamela said there was a strong view from the conference that the party needs to put in strong legislation to deal with "people who damage public property". "We have seen recently where communities protesting lead to the destruction of schools and other public property," Manamela said, adding that the ANC strongly condemns this behaviour. The ANC in Gauteng recommended that prostitution be decriminalised, but Sisulu said the notion would be shut down.
