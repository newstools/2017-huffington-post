President Donald Trump tweeted Wednesday that transgender people would not be allowed to serve in the U.S. military. In June 2016, the Pentagon lifted a ban against transgender men and women serving in the military. "Our mission is to defend this country, and we don't want barriers unrelated to a person's qualification to serve preventing us from recruiting or retaining the soldier, sailor, airman or Marine who can best accomplish the mission," then-Defense Secretary Ashton Carter said. "We have to have access to 100% of America's population for our all-volunteer force to be able to recruit from among them the most highly qualified — and to retain them." Trump ― who argued during the 2016 campaign he was better for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans than his Democratic opponent, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ― dodged the draft a total of five times, once arguing he couldn't serve in the U.S. military because of bone spurs in his heels.
