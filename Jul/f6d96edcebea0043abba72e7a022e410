Over the weekend, the eldest son of President Donald Trump admitted that he met with a lawyer linked to the Russian government last June after being promised damaging information on Trump's opponent, Hillary Clinton.The meeting, also reportedly attended by then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Trump's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner, is the first confirmed meeting between Trump's inner circle and Kremlin-linked Russians. It raises new questions as multiple investigations look into whether Trump's campaign colluded with the Russian government to interfere in last year's election.Donald Trump Jr. initially offered few details about his meeting with the lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, whose clients have included Russian state-owned businesses and the son of a senior Russian government official. Following The New York Times' initial story about the meeting, the younger Trump said they "primarily discussed" an adoption program.But just a day later, after the Times revealed more information, he offered a much more substantive description and said the pretext for the meeting was "potentially helpful information" about Clinton.
