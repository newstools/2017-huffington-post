Nicole Kidman is, as they say, on fire. The recent Emmy nominee has been a Hollywood staple for decades now, and somehow manages to keep surprising us. She appears on the latest cover of U.K.-based Love Magazine in a cowboy hat by Stetson, Cartier gold necklace and red swimsuit by Love Stories Swim Club. “I thought about this shoot afterwards. I was like, ‘What was I doing?,’” she said, according to Love. ”‘I lost my mind! How are the shots? Do they look crazy?’” On Instagram, the mag shared a few more photos from the shoot, which features riding chaps and lots of denim.
