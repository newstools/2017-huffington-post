Kim Kardashian just isn’t herself, according to an online test. On Tuesday night, the reality TV star took a BuzzFeed quiz to find out whether she was “more Kim Kardashian or Chrissy Teigen.” And the result left her somewhat surprised: Wait I got @chrissyteigen pic.twitter.com/IWvtZ4b8Mu That’s right — it told Kardashian she was actually more like Teigen. Assuming she answered the questions on her favorite snacks, shoes and pets truthfully, the quiz’s results said Kardashian was ”exactly like Chrissy” ― her friend IRL. Had the quiz’s algorithm decided that Kardashian was actually “more like” herself, however, it would have described her as being “sweet, stylish, and a lover of the finer things in life” and as having “a great business sense.” Teigen has apparently yet to take the test. People online await with bated breath. pic.twitter.com/c6f9pP70UW
