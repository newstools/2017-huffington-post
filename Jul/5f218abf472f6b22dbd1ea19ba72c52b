Season 4's debut of Please Step In summed up in a tweet: Twenty-one-year-old Theresia Mashaba wrote into the show asking for an intervention. She said she was involved in transactional relationships to get money to survive, money her mother would ask her for. While these situations are complex, here are a few places young women in Mashaba's situation can reach out to for help, emotional and otherwise - because no young person's circumstances should force them to sleep with men to survive: It was also revealed on the show that Theresia was raped at 15 - by her stepfather - and her mother asked her to keep it quiet. The case was later withdrawn. Any abuse victim has rights, and if you know of someone who has been abused, here are their rights and places they can go to for help. And although the urgent intervention required for such cases requires a multi-stakeholder approach, it's always heartwarming when South Africans rally together and offer to help: @Mzansimagic can you assist us , some of us are looking for Theresia . We want go help #PleaseStepIn
