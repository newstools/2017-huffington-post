Bell Pottinger said on Thursday it was sorry for work it did with the Gupta family and Oakbay. But South Africans are not buying it, we need more. "At various points throughout the tenure of the Oakbay account, senior management have been misled about what has been done. For it to be done in South Africa, a country which has become an international beacon of hope for its progress towards racial reconciliation, is a matter of profound regret and in no way reflects the values of Bell Pottinger," the public relations said. The firm claimed it was "misled" and acted to rectify that as soon as it realised. On Twitter, however, South Africans hit back saying they did not care about the apology and it was not enough to deal with the damage the company caused. These were some of the responses on the social media platform.  #BellPottinger 'apology' won't undo the damage done & the demonising of so many good South Africans. Tell all & pay back This is spin. Who misled them? How much did they pay their bots? We demand disclosure! https://t.co/M6xVEq3Bb4 #BellPottinger #Savesa demands full disclosure from PR firm #Bellpottinger about the nature of its dirty tricks while contracted to the Guptas pic.twitter.com/220kRzkNus #BellPottinger is now claiming that their senior management was "misled" about work on the Oakbay account. pic.twitter.com/9iZHKa4zoC Let us never forget that the Guptas funded this hideous campaign by #BellPottinger to deflect public criticism from the corrupt #Zumas pic.twitter.com/IrKTkI9QRl #BellPottinger thanks for wrecking our country (South Africa) and sowing seeds of discontent This is nonsense indeed as South African your apology is not good enough and will never be accepted, time to face the music #BellPottinger #BellPottinger's apology is nothing but odious spin doctoring.
