The South African National Editors Forum took Black First Land First to court on Thursday over freedom and protection of journalists, following the group's attack on journalists. Media freedom is on the agenda following BLF attacks on certain journalists, in particularly the intimidation of former Business Day and Financial Mail editor Peter Bruce. Here is an update on the court proceedings: @SAEditorsForum at Court 9F for media freedom, against media intimidation. Land is a just struggle. Violence against journalists is not. pic.twitter.com/WlfPyV1XYW  Editors gathered in SG High Court for interdict app vs BLF. @SAEditorsForum represented by Adv Tembeka Ngcukaitobi. pic.twitter.com/PknOLOPoZ1  Adv. Tembeka Ngcukaitobi for @SAEditorsForum lays out how Black Land First intimidated @KarimaBrown and @timcohensa @Bruceps home.  Judge says @SAEditorsForum has stressed in its papers it is not challenging right to protest. #SANEFvsBLF https://t.co/dZnRMRpOIe  This is not what @Black1stLand1st says in court. Counsel says journalists are educated people who can lay charges if assaulted. #SANEFvsBLF https://t.co/bSKJ7ONsQW  Court packed out. Two benches of journalists. Two rows of @Black1stLand1st activists who also line walls. Rule of law. 🇿🇦#SANEFvsBLF  @SAEditorsForum says it supports right to protest but should be at media HQ not at individual's home #SANEFvsBLF  Ngcukaitobi: Brown was assaulted by BLF in presence of @SAPoliceService.
