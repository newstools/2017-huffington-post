The first four days of the ANC policy conference has shown tell-tale signs of a party that is trying to save itself, but doesn't seem to know exactly how. It has been a period of self-reflection for the party, as members scramble to fix its image on the back of declining public support. At the same time, there have been wild contradictions, making it difficult to anticipate exactly what may come from this meeting. This is what we have seen so far: Honesty without transparency: Promise of pipe dream policy - They've got 99 problems but Zuma isn't one: The conference continues on Tuesday with a presentation by Minister in the Presidency Jeff Radebe at a business breakfast. Afterwards, commissions will sit to discuss sectoral issues ahead of an expected media briefing by Human Settlements Minister Lindiwe Sisulu.
