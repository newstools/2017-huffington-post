When we were black women, we used to walk this rich land with abundance on our lips warmth woven in our grip, rhythm pulsing in our hips and viewed the world through sun-kissed eyelids.  When we were black women, our crowns mirrored pride rather than disgust our bodies belonged to us our hearts were soaked in trust our brothers would kill to protect us.  Now, the Earth orbits anti-clockwise we see bullets rather than birds fly not in the end of days but during femicide because a black woman is born a crime.  Now, we mine for black women in a boyfriend's backyard inside the boot of taxis and cars, at playgrounds and children's parks behind 'kwa-next door' after dark.  Like water, our emancipation is fluid filling the cracks of an unjust society 'enough' loses its strength in OUR vocabulary because once, we visited the president at his residency,  changed our minds when it came to sexuality, wore our clothes a little too tightly, proceeded to smile whilst flirting, had the nerve to ignore the cat-calling and being labelled as a 'bitch who loves back chatting'.  When we were black women, our OPTIONS became critical life choices of how to survive and stay alive.
