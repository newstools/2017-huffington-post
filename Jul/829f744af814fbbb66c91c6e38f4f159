The news was officially announced at the D23 Expo in Anaheim, California, on Saturday: Mena Massoud and Naomi Scott are your new Aladdin and Jasmine in Guy Ritchie's live remake of the animated classic. Will Smith will play the Genie, which was already rumored. Massoud is a Canadian actor whose credits include the series "Jack Ryan," "Open Heart" and "Saving Hope." Scott also has an impressive resume, recently starring as Kimberly Hart, the Pink Ranger, in the big-screen "Power Rangers" reboot.

Many people suggested Dev Patel or Riz Ahmed, who were both reportedly looked at for the part of Aladdin. Even though the part didn't go to either of those actors, Twitter seemed to approve of Saturday's news: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
