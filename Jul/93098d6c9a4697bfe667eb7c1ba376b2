Thabo "Tbo Touch" Molefe was never ready for what happened after he took to Twitter on Tuesday night to urge his followers to change the way they think. Molefe tweeted that the only difference between him and a street beggar was their "mental disposition".  Tweeps did not take the matter lying down and called for him to delete the tweet, which many found offensive. Celebrities subtweeted the 36-year-old businessperson, calling him out on his tweet. To be in the business of needing black people to support you but all you see of black poverty is lack of mental capacity in their part? Tsek  "let's change how we think"... I'm trying and it's not working 😢😢😢 pic.twitter.com/dn61XUTjgz  Trying to change the way I 💭.... Humnn.... nop, not working! I need more than that. Something tells me,so does the beggar I saw on my way 🏡 pic.twitter.com/qrs8lqgqEj  It can't be ONLY difference when we don't know people's journeys & circumstances. 1 day in his shoes will teach u s'thing if u survive it https://t.co/gmHQo34RG9  Responding to his tweet, Molefe's followers expressed disappointment in him for tweeting and "thinking" like he did. Life is harder than you make it sound Touch. Trust. No one starts out in life with the negative intention of ending up begging on the street  the more I read this statement from Touch the more upset I get. It's rough outhere man for most of us. Anyone can end up on the streets...  This statement hurts so much💔 not everyone will be rich the way he is. We from different backgrounds and that affects our progress 😭😭  I'm hurt. Does he know the struggles that people go through to try and make it? Did he stop and find out the story of that person's life? No  Let's not forget when Sizwe Dlomo a few days ago went for the jugular: pic.twitter.com/ENu1YsAHBU  Despite numerous calls for him to take down his tweet, Molefe left it up and continued with his life and instead, tweeting about the 100 days celebration of his online radio station, Touch HD. Today we're 110 days @TouchHDOnline thank for your continued support & making us the hottest number Digital HD Radio @GlenLewisSA up next
