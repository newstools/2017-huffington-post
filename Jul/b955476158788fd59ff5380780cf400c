Prince George gets lots of that irresistible cuteness from his dad, never-before-seen family photos show. Prince William and Prince Harry released five photos from their mother's personal album over the weekend in advance of the 20th anniversary of Princess Diana's death August 31. The set includes sweet shots of the boys on vacation with their mom (who's pregnant with Harry in the pink sweater photo!), along with a pic of some pretty precious constable costumes. A new exhibit at Buckingham Palace features more family photos, along with some of Diana's belongings like ballet shoes and cassette tapes. The display, much of which sits atop the desk Diana used at Kensington Palace, opened for viewing on Saturday and closes Oct. 1.
