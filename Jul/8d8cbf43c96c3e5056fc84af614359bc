The BBC points out &ldquo;high-ranking officials&rdquo; usually cover for leaders when they are absent.It&rsquo;s not clear exactly why Trump left the meeting, nor how long he was away. The original tweet suggested it was so he could attend &ldquo;bilateral talks.&rdquo;A BBC correspondent noted that Ivanka Trump &ldquo;did not seem to make any major contribution to the session&rdquo; during the time she was filling in.Donald Trump had earlier used a World Bank session on women&rsquo;s entrepreneurship to sing his daughter&rsquo;s praises.
