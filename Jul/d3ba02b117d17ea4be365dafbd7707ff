If you missed the Vodacom Durban July on Saturday, don't panic, HuffPost SA has your back. This year's theme was The Colour of Magic and celebrities had their own interpretations. We must say though fam, choosing a favourite was not hard we will just blame that on the poor celebrity turnout at this year's instalment. Although red is known as the colour of magic, we cannot get over Nomuzi Mabena's interpretation. The rapper and presenter donned a black number, her interpretation was all about black girl magic. We absolutely loved it. Here are eleven of our favourite celeb looks from yesterday. #OnArrival #VDJ2017 look @casperdesigner ...it's beautiful ❤️❤️❤️ thank you 😘😘 A post shared by Thando Thabooty Thabethe (@thando_thabethe) on Jul 1, 2017 at 9:14am PDT 🖤✨ BLACK GIRL MAGIC ✨🖤 #VDJ2017 🐎 Dress: @ivylillycouture Shoes: @stevemadden Make Up: @preciousxabamakeup Hair: @ceeceeeee 📸: @simzphoto A post shared by Moozlie (@moozlie) on Jul 1, 2017 at 11:03am PDT WELCOME TO MY HOUSE PARTY😉| @opulentexperience #VDJ | Dressed by @biji_la_maison | Styled by @kgosilesego | Makeup by @clarabanx | Hair by : @liyandaexperience | 📸: @feshendotcoza A post shared by AYANDA THABETHE (@ayandathabethe_) on Jul 1, 2017 at 4:49am PDT Touch Down | Mr Bearings 🚀 #AfroMarquee2017 #DurbanJuly2017 A post shared by djtira (@djtira) on Jul 1, 2017 at 2:07am PDT #🇿🇦VillageGirl just 🍭👗👑👠💄📸 before the race!!! #sesadi #pediandurban by @antherline ... #matome wa ga Seshole! #yourthebest | thanks to the Department Of Sports Arts And Culture #VDJ2017 #LimpopoKeGae #kezwazweo A post shared by #🇿🇦V I L L A G E G I R L (@candytsamandebelesa) on Jul 1, 2017 at 6:59am PDT #the color of magic #VDJ🏇🏽... well done @gertjohancoetzee 👗🔥👌🏾 A post shared by Norma Gigaba (@norma.gigaba) on Jul 1, 2017 at 6:42am PDT Uthando Nes'thembu's MaKhumalo went with green as her Colour of magic. #VDJ2017 A post shared by HuffPost SA (@huffpostsa) on Jul 1, 2017 at 5:50am PDT 👑👑👑 in @quiteria_george 🎨Beam Beat by @preciousxabamakeup #Dstv_VDJ #VDJ2017 #HostDuties 📸 @aust_malema A post shared by Dineo Moeketsi (@dineomoeketsi) on Jul 1, 2017 at 7:35am PDT  Omunye nomunye nomunt'wakhe. 😍 #VDJ2017 👑 x 👑 in @quiteria_george 📸 @aust_malema A post shared by Dineo Moeketsi (@dineomoeketsi) on Jul 1, 2017 at 12:18pm PDT 9.
