The driver's 78-year-old husband, Jerome Barson, was in the passenger seat and sustained a head injury. He died two weeks later.Before the tournament started, Williams addressed the crash on her Facebook page.Williams has won Wimbledon five times. She's considered one of the favorites to win this year.
