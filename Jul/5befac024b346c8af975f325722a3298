ANC Member of Parliament Makhosi Khoza has been vocal about the issues plaguing the ANC, including the no-confidence vote regarding President Jacob Zuma, intimidation and the consequences of voting against Zuma. In response, the office of Chief Whip Jackson Mthembu has released a statement recommending that the party take disciplinary action against her. It gives the following reasons for instituting such action: The statement goes on to say that the chief whip's office and ANC leaders have spoken to Khoza on many occasions, but that "it appears as though comrade Khoza has defined herself outside of the collective of the ANC parliamentary caucus and is acting like an independent member of Parliament and a free agent who will not subject herself to organisational processes and discipline". People in the party have intimidated Khoza on various occasions, with the youth league calling for her removal as an MP and threatening her. Police Minister Fikile Mbalula has said previously that anyone who voted against Zuma would be "dealt with" and likened them to suicide bombers. The statement ends by "reiterating that nobody in our organisation or in the country has the right to vilify or threaten her and her family".
