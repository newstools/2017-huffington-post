I think I can confidently say that myself and HuffPost SA's engagement editor, Shandukani Mulaudzi, looked all sorts of flames at this year's Vodacom Durban July. Thanks to Spree and Lalalux Jozi, we took Durban by storm at the weekend armed with some of the best kotini (threads) money can buy. We think the only reason we did not walk away with the best-dressed award at the horse-racing event was because the judges didn't see us. But that's okay, because we still slayed and we are happy for Norma Gigaba, who was crowned the day's best-dressed woman. Our looks are available from the following links: 1. For the main event, Shandu went with the Bombshell Multiwrap dress available here. I donned the Ribbon detail dress, which you can get here. Our Engagement Editor @shandumul and Entertainment Reporter @duenna_mm are at the Durban July bringing you all the fashion updates. Stay glued to Instagram and Twitter and Facebook. üêéüíÉüèø Theme: Colour of Magic: Red Dressed by @spreecoza ‚ù§Ô∏è #VDJ2017 A post shared by HuffPost SA (@huffpostsa) on Jul 1, 2017 at 5:18am PDT   2.
