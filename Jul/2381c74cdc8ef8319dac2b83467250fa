So, as it turned out over the weekend, Bontle Modiselle and her beau, Ricardo Moloi are not engaged, yet. The pair sparked engagement rumours when Modiselle posted a snap of her Moloi, known popularly by his stage name, Priddy Ugly, on one knee proposing to her.
She captioned the picture with lyrics to Wale and Usher's song, "Matrimony", "If there's a question of my heart, you've got it. It don't belong to anyone but you". On Friday, Moloi shared snaps of him and Modiselle saying they had given exclusive footage to their special celebration to SABC1's "Live Amp" and that people should tune in. The couple is featured in the music video of the song, "I do" by LaSauce, real name Sindisiwe Magoso. Tonight, it all comes full circle to a special moment.
