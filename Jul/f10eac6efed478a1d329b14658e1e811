Although games such as Pokemon GO, Minecraft and Power Rangers monopolise the top of the most-downloaded app lists, look hard enough and you'll find a growing number of apps for business that can benefit the output of your 9 to 5. Check out this pick of the top 20 apps for business: Productivity 1. Evernote  Evernote allows you to take notes in the form of text, photos, sketches, audio, video, PDF and web clippings. We love it because it functions as a digital notepad that we can store our ideas on as they come, and it syncs automatically with all devices. 2. Roambi Analytics  Roambi Analytics makes data friendly to use and easy to understand. The app turns business data into analytics in the form of interactive charts and graphs designed for mobile use. Roambi Analytics can be used for customer interactions, data-rich presentations and field reporting. 3. Pocket  When you find something you want to view later, put it in Pocket. This app allows you to easily save links directly from your web browser, email or over 1,500 apps. It saves you time and avoids cluttering your bookmarks bar. 4.
