Roads in and out of Imizamo Yethu, Hout Bay, remained closed on Tuesday after protests in the area. On Saturday, angry residents protested over what they said was the City of Cape Town's sluggish response to the damage caused by a fire in March that left 15,000 people homeless. Locals took to the streets and police reportedly used stun grenades and rubber bullets to disperse the crowd.   Residents say the City of Cape Town promised that they would be relocated back to re-blocked structures after three months, but that this has not happened. They have been living in a temporary relocation area in zinc structures since the fire in March. Disgruntled Hout Bay residents have taken their protest to the streets and are erecting their shacks on the street.
