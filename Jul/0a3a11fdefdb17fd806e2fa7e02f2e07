We think we know who had the most fun at this year's Vodacom Durban July, and it wasn't Zodwa Wabantu.The devil isn't winning today. Black Twitter have finally dressed Zodwa Wabantu #DurbanJuly #VDJ2017 #DurbanJuly2017 pic.twitter.com/hmt3kl99pgWhile Wabantu probably took the accolade for talk of the Durban July, it was MEC for Sports, Arts and Culture in Limpopo Onicca Moloi who was the host with the most.The horseracing event may have come and gone, but we are convinced that Moloi had more fun than even some of the celebrities at the Greyville Racecourse.In what she termed Limpopo Invades Tepen, Moloi's lounge hosted artists, designers, a comedian and a DJ.Moloi, who is also a qualified chef made sure everyone knew she was having the time of her life.. Here's proof.1. The betting:Then I tell my uncle my where abouts..Now Im at a queue for some Conglomerates, Edict of Nantes, ten gun salute ,black Arthur...Siphi?2. Moloi danced the night away on Saturday:We are on the issue of letheka...Excuse me Im on duty #LimpopoInvadesTepenExcuse us we on duty #LimpopoInvadesTepenA post shared by The Pure One (@onicca_moloi) on Jul 1, 2017 at 11:17am PDT3. And she rubbed shoulders with the who's whoLe rakgadi wa bana ba Limpopo @candytsamandebelesa #LimpopoInvadesTepenWhile on duty...#Gushima #Limpopo4. And she was not done yet. On Sunday, Moloi attended the jazz event held at the Durban Botanical Gardens.We Outchea Amanda Black on stage 5. By home time, we weren't sure if she would be out partying anytime soon:Nie meer!If you thought your Durban July weekend was the best experience, you might want to think again.
