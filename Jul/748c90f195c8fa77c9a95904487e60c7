The companies provided e-tags , printing and distributing invoices for the e-toll system. Kapsch Sweden and Q-Free have been in charge of e-tag provision and upkeep of the service. According to Fin24, Kapsch TrafficCom (a subsidiary of Austrian company Kapsch) received R167.2 million, while Q-Free got R58.3 million for providing e-tags. Both figures are exclusive of VAT. An additional payment of R225 million for e-tags provision was also paid out. Transport Minister Joe Maswanganyi revealed the informtion in answer to a parliamentary posed by the Democratic Alliance's Chris Hunsinger about the breakdown of payments to third parties for e-toll collection and e-tag provision. Fin24 reported that Sanral paid a further R327.2 million to the respective companies since the end of 2013 for printing and posting for e- toll collection. These amounts were also exclusive VAT.
