Bonang Matheba's star-studded 30th birthday celebration may have come and gone, but we would still like to know if, by any chance, Kelly Khumalo inspired her choice of outfit. Although Matheba's birthday was on June 25, the media personality chose to celebrate on Saturday, July 8. While the party was underway, Khumalo took to Twitter to remind us all that she wore a similar dress a to the South African Music Awards (Samas) in May. In the tweet, she tagged her designer, Khothatso Laurence Tsotetsi, who made her outfit for the awards ceremony. Matheba's dress was made by her favourite designer, Gert-Johan Coetzee. Deja vu 🤣🤣🤣🤣   But, true to form, tweeps went in on Khumalo's post, sharing their own opinions. 1. Those who believed that Bonang had stolen Khumalo's look:    Copy and paste! I feel you sis! pic.twitter.com/ztOGn85Kb5 2. Then those who felt Khumalo should not have thrown shade at Matheba and that she should have known better:    Although both designers Tsotetsi and Coetzee have not responded to the post, the jury is still out on whether Queen B stole Khumalo's look. What if she just liked it and felt it was perfect for her 30th celebration? ....thank you @gertjohancoetzee for all you do for me. I love you! 💕👑 #LasNight #My30th  Phew, such drama.
