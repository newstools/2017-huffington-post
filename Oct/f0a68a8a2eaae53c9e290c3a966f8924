Bruce Willis went the whole nine yards this Halloween. The “Die Hard” star went dressed as one of the terrifying twins from “The Shining” for M. Night Shyamalan’s “Shyamaween” party in Philadelphia on Saturday night. Willis’ assistant, Stephen J. Eads, did the honors of being his spooky sibling: Fellow Hollywood star Samuel L. Jackson shared the above snap of the pair online. Most Twitter users appeared to agree that despite being seriously scary, Willis totally nailed the costume:  pic.twitter.com/6FP55MbUne  pic.twitter.com/DXOVX3Nwp1
