Merely thinking about the word diet can conjure up some not-so-positive thoughts. "Restrictions", "hunger" and "tastelessness" are words that come to mind -- never mind past attempts at dieting that failed or were just not sustainable. But it turns out that if you are on a diet, at least in Johannesburg, you do not have to give up your favourites completely -- you just need to know where to find their healthier versions. So whether you are Banting, or on a military or a Daniel fast diet, or just looking for healthier alternatives -- be sure to check out local places where you can satisfy your palate healthily.

Col'Cacchio's Vegan Pizzas The Italian pizzeria chain, which has various branches around Gauteng, offers carb-conscious pizza alternatives and plenty of vegan options.     3. Voodoo Lily Cafe This Banting-friendly establishment in Birdhaven offers wholesome and delicious food.
