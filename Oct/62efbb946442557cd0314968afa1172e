Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba had a number of people fooled when he presented his medium-term budget policy statement to parliament on Wednesday. His eloquence, coupled with not referring to his manual presentation caused many to wonder how he managed to memorise an 8,000 worded presentation, figures and all. Not to say, it's an impossible feat.       It turns out, however, that those mysterious green plants were hiding the not-so-visible teleprompters. Best thing about #MTBPS2017 is that it looks like we finally installed teleprompters!

Of course, there were those who felt Zuma could learn a thing or two from how Gigaba presented his speech today: ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚Zuma reads his speech from the first till the last minute!
I wonder how he's feeling when his son in crime is just flowing #MTBPS2017  #MalusiGigaba presentation skills ðŸ’¯
Ngathi he is programmed Can't Gigaba teach uBaba how to read from a teleprompter? #malusigigaba #MTBPS2017
