A little nip slip never hurt anybody. Just ask Chrissy Teigen. The supermodel learned the hard way that Snapchatting while getting a spray tan is only for the most skilled of multitaskers when she accidentally flashed her nipple on the app Wednesday. Teigen was caught unaware, happily going about her day documenting a meal with husband John Legend until responses from concerned fans came flooding in. The "Lip Sync Battle" host quickly caught on, however, seemingly addressing the issue with a "whoops" on Twitter. But apparently her assistant ― hired for these things, of course ― had already intervened, pulling the video down from her Snapchat. Teigen took a screenshot of their text conversation (sounds like she's planning a bingo night?) to give followers an inside look at her glamorous life. "What is it like being an assistant in Hollywood, you ask?" she wrote alongside the photo. She wasn't done just yet, though, as she took to Snapchat to jokingly apologize to her followers for exposing herself in a peak Chrissy way. "I just want to apologize to everyone I know. I've let my friends down. I've let my family down," she said. "I have nipples. It's not something I'm proud of." "I'm sorry you had to see that," she added later on Snapchat. "I have nipples. I do have nipples. I'm sorry." We must protect her at all costs. Share this slide:
