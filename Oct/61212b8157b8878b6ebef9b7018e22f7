A Paralympian has well and truly won Halloween with his genius costume. Josh Sundquist, 33, had his left leg amputated after being diagnosed with bone cancer at the age of nine.  The self-confessed “halloween enthusiast” and comedian has created inventive costumes ever since and this year is no exception. The US Paralympic Ski Team member has transformed himself into ‘Winnie the Pooh’s’ Tigger for the holidays, using his leg as the tail. This isn’t the first time Josh has wowed the internet with his costume. In 2016, Josh, who also plays for the US Amputee Soccer Team, morphed into Lumière (the singing candle) from ‘Beauty and the Beast’.  Josh’s other hilarious past creations include a flamingo and a foosball player. “I started making these costumes seven years ago to make my friends laugh at Halloween parties,” Josh told HuffPost UK. “Which is still why I make them, it’s just that recently the internet has made that party much, much bigger. Which is great because I feel like I’ve been put on earth to delight and entertain people. “Sometimes I do that on a stage as a motivational speaker and comedian. At Halloween, I do that by wearing creative costumes.” He added that his costumer inspiration comes from “all over”. “I got the idea for the flamingo when I was at the zoo and noticed that flamingos look kind of like me doing a crutch handstand,” he said. “My wife suggested the leg lamp. Someone on the internet last year thought of the Tigger costume.” We can’t wait to see what he comes up with in 2018.
