KFC’s Twitter game is finger lickin’ good. In a marketing move that Colonel Sanders himself would have been proud of, someone on Twitter noticed the fast-food chain is highly selective about who it follows on the micro-blogging service. As Twitter user @edgette22 noted on Thursday, KFC  only follows 11 people ― the five former members of the Spice Girls, and six men named Herb. .@KFC follows 11 people.Those 11 people? 5 Spice Girls and 6 guys named Herb. 11 Herbs & Spices. I need time to process this. “11 Herbs & Spices. I need time to process this,” the tweeter wrote. Indeed, the analysis is correct: KFC has long marketed its chicken as the product of a secret recipe with “11 herbs and spices.” It’s unclear how long KFC had to wait until someone spotted the subtle stunt, which appears to have gone down well with other Twitter users: the person that runs the KFC account needs a raise. I don't care how much they make now. GIVE THEM A RAISE. I don’t know who I’m more impressed with, @KFC for doing it or @edgette22 for noticing it https://t.co/avXAV1EkFm "FINALLY" --KFC social media manager Mind = blown. Honestly I'm too hype about this  pic.twitter.com/n4TSZOzLP8 They must have a seasoned marketing person. 😉😉 #seewhatIdidthere What a want, what I really really want is a Spice Girl to bring me a bucket of mostly drumsticks #WellPlayedKFC
