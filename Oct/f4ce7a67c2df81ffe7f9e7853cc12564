The Pretoria high court may have thrown the Gupta family a lifeline on Monday when it ordered Indian state-owned Bank of Baroda to keep the existing accounts of Gupta-linked companies with the bank open, according to Fin24. But the order only keeps the Gupta accounts open for now, pending a final application that must be launched within 15 days. The Gupta-owned companies submitted the application after the India-based bank gave the companies until the end of September to remove the money from their accounts.

      Many of the businesses are having financial problems, such as being unable to pay employees and conduct business.
