Musician, ward councillor and now reality TV star Penny Penny is set to release a new hip-hop song on Tuesday as part of his newly revealed genre, Heavy Gum. The 57-year-old, real name Eric Kobane told Sunday World that as a legend, it was natural for him to reinvent himself over time.

My music was referred to as 'bubblegum' in years gone by. So I decided to call this 'heavy gum' to symbolise a gum that remains sweet forever," Kobane said. According to the publication, the single has a video already in production which will see him surrounded by a group of sexy women while smoking a cigar and drinking expensive spirits around a swimming pool.
