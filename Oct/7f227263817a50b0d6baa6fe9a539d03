ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe believes that, if the country's top post is not handed down to Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa come the party's national conference in December, the ANC will fall into "crisis". In a series of tweets on Tuesday night, Mantashe said if President Jacob Zuma's succession is not "managed properly", the results may be "disastrous". If Pres Zuma, with experience, refuses to handover to DP, we will be in a crisis. Let us find a woman to be DP, for succession to be managed  When succession is not managed properly, results become disastrous #ORTambo  Suggesting a female deputy to Ramaphosa, it is likely that Mantashe was hinting at Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma for second place -- which entrenches the idea of a unified slate including members of both camps to avoid a contest in December. Leadership of #ANC has a responsibility to manage succession. We can't have accidental leadership succession as a 105 organisation #ORTambo  There's a theory of a woman President. That's strange. We want a President of the ANC, male or female. #ORTambo  If a sitting DP, cannot take over from the incumbent, organisation is owed an explanation, so that ANC must be at peace with itself #ORTambo
