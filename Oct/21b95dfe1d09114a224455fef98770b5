Farming communities throughout South Africa took to the streets on Monday to raise awareness about farm attacks and killings in a "Black Monday" mass protest. A convoy of tractors, trucks and bakkies will head to the Mother City from Stellenbosch to highlight the killing of farmers. Farmers in Polokwane, as well as the Free State, are also participating in the protest.
