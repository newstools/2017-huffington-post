The real Slim Shady is standing up to President Donald Trump.  Eminem slammed the president as a “kamikaze that will probably cause a nuclear holocaust” in a cypher recorded for Tuesday night’s 2017 BET Hip Hop Awards.  The brutal 4½-minute takedown, called “The Storm,” features the Detroit rapper taking on Trump and his supporters over racism, gun control, immigration, Twitter feuds and more. Eminem rapped:   It’s like we take a step forwards then backwardsBut this is his form of distractionPlus he gets an enormous reactionWhen he attacks the NFL so we focus on that andInstead of talking Puerto Rico or gun reform for NevadaAll these horrible tragedies and he’s bored or would ratherCause a Twitter storm with the Packers Eminem also drew a line for his fans: If you’re for Trump... you can’t be with him.  “And if you can’t decide who you like more and you’re split on who you should stand beside, I’ll do it for you with this,” he said, extending his middle finger right at the camera. “Fuck you!” Check it out above. Eminem has been a frequent Trump critic. Last year, during the campaign, he released a track calling Trump a “fucking loose cannon.” Earlier this year, on Big Sean’s “No Favors,” he called Trump a “bitch.” And over the summer, the rapper led a “fuck Trump” chant at the Reading Festival.  Share this slide:
