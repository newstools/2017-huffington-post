Photographs of Vladimir Putin cuddling and kissing his cute new puppy sent internet users into overdrive. The Russian president received the adorable alabai dog as a belated 65th birthday gift from his Turkmenistan counterpart, Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov, on Wednesday, Reuters reported. It didn’t take long for people to reimagine the encounter in all kinds of amusing ways, including reworking the snaps to mock President Donald Trump.
