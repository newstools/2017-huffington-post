Lulu the black Labrador wasn’t cut out for a career as a bomb sniffer dog. The CIA announced on Wednesday that it had made the tough decision to drop the 18-month-old dog from its K9 training program after she lost interest in learning how to detect explosives. “All dogs, just like most human students, have good days and bad days when learning something new,” the CIA wrote on its website. “But for some dogs, like Lulu, it becomes clear that the issue isn’t temporary. Instead, this just isn’t the job they are meant for.” #CIAK9 Pupdate:Sometimes, even after testing, our pups make it clear being an explosive detection K9 isn’t for themhttps://t.co/nPZl6YWNKb pic.twitter.com/07TXRCH7bp We’re sad to announce that a few weeks into training, Lulu began to show signs that she wasn’t interested in detecting explosive odors. pic.twitter.com/c6lxHPfC09 All dogs, like humans, have good & bad days when learning something new.Same for our pups, though it usually lasts just a day or two. pic.twitter.com/z9lQa2uKX4 Lulu, who was being trained for the Fairfax County Police Department in Virginia, was adopted by her handler, the CIA reported. She’s now adjusting to a regular pet’s life by spending her days “playing with his kids, sniffing out rabbits and squirrels in the backyard and eating meals and snacks out of a dog dish.” Lulu wasn’t interested in searching for explosives.Even when motivated w food & play, she was clearly no longer enjoying herself. pic.twitter.com/puvhDk1tRX Our trainers’ top concern is physical & mental well-being of K9s.They made difficult decision & did what’s best for Lulu: stop her training pic.twitter.com/Ss9y9LpE9q Although the CIA said it would miss Lulu, removing her from the program “was the right decision for her.” Lulu was adopted by her handler & now enjoys her days playing w his kids & a new friend, & sniffing out rabbits & squirrels in the backyard. pic.twitter.com/WOImM75P1D Lulu’s happy ending received a positive reception on Twitter: What a great thread.  Dogs are like people...even if someone is able to do a job, doesn’t mean they like it or are cut out for it.   Thank you, CIA, for having Lulu’s best interests at heart.  She looks like a darling girl. this thread is the best thing I've seen on Twitter in forever. Thank you. Aw, thanks CIA for giving her a happy ending 😍! pic.twitter.com/zZJNnQDHrV Congrats, Lulu! Enjoy retirement! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 Congrats to Lulu & her new, furever hooman family!  🐾🐾 Wish her all the love, car rides, squirrel chases & hugs that ALL 🐕s deserve
