South African zazz legend Hugh Masekela released a statement on riday where he revealed that he has been battling prostate cancer and has been in treatment since 2008, after doctors discovered a small "speck" on his bladder. "The treatment seemed to be successful, but in March 2016 I had to undergo surgery as the cancer had spread," he said. Read the full statement below:
In April 2017, while in Morocco I fell and sprained my shoulder. I began to feel an imbalance when I was walking and my left eye was troubling me. Another tumour was discovered and subsequently, in September 2017, I had emergency treatment, and the tumour was neutralised. It is a tough battle but I am greatly encouraged by the good wishes of family, friends and everyone who has supported my musical journey, which remains the greatest source of my inspiration. I have cancelled my commitments for the immediate future as I will need all my energy to continue this fight against prostate cancer. I'm in a good space, as I battle this stealthy disease, and I urge all men to have regular tests to check your own condition. Ask questions, demand answers and learn everything you can about this cancer, and tell others to do the same. This will be the only public statement I make on the matter, and I ask for privacy going forward, so that I may rest and heal."
