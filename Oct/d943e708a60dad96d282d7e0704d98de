South African celebrities have been living their best lives in Paris recently and we couldn't help but wonder if the French city has become the new Dubai -- an ultimate destination for the rich and famous. In September alone, six local personalities visited Paris for various reasons and we're grateful they took us along via their Instagram feeds. 1. Minnie Dlamini (Jones) The newly-wed Mrs Jones jetted off to Paris for a bachelorette party with her bridesmaids, ahead of her big day on September 16.

Reggie Nkabinde The ANC Youth League treasurer general and Mabala Noise owner and his wife, Beauty, were in Paris for their honeymoon and their photos gave us FOMO. The couple also made a stop in the Middle East. Eiffel Tower...beautiful...#Paris   3. Bonang Matheba The reality show star, author and all-around media personality had a front-row seat at Paris Fashion Week. She also made a stop and had some fun with Courvoisier. Her cousin, Tebogo Mekgwe aka Pinky Girl, and her rapper boyfriend AKA, real name Kiernan Forbes, took the trip with her.
