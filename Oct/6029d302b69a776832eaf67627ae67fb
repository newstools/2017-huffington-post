"Apleni believes that the minister does not have the powers to suspend him... the crux of the case is that he is challenging the powers of the minister to suspend him," his attorney, SJ Thema, said at the time. Thema also told News24 that his client had filed a supplementary affidavit to deal with Mkhize's comments during an eNCA interview in which she said Apleni was "unstable and delusional".
