Socialite Pulane Lenkoe revealed on social media that she suffered physical abuse by a partner. Alongside a series of pictures she posted to Instagram on Tuesday, Lenkoe wrote a detailed account of how the alleged abuse happened and affected her. She said the last incident happened six months ago and that she regrets not having kept the photos from the first incident. "The first time he beat me (I wish I had kept the pics, but he convinced me to delete them in order for us to move on after he told me he will never allow himself to touch me again. [He] blamed it on stress and insecurities, so I forgave him), funny thing is that I always considered myself to be very strong, I guess we all have our weaknesses. I allowed this man who promised to love, protect and make me feel safe to do this to me over and over and over and over again, and each time he would swear he'd never touch me again (sic)," her post read.
