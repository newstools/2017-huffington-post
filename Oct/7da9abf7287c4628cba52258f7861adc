A grandmother in the U.S. has learned the age-old lesson to never judge a book by its cover after accidentally giving her six-year-old granddaughter a book described as "definitely not for all ages" Twitter user Tiffany (@Tiffany1985B) shared pictures of the 'If Animals Could Talk' book on Wednesday after tweeting that she had called her mother to "ask if she had actually opened the book". Spoiler alert: she hadn't.  The book's origins trace back to a Tumblr account created by co-authors Josh Cassidy and Carla Butwin. 'If ______ CouldTalk' featured jokes penned by Cassidy accompanied by Butwin's drawings. Think you know what your favourite animals might be thinking? Think again.
