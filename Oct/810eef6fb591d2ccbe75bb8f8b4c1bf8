TV weather forecaster Kawser Quamer giggled her way through a report after the wrong chyron hilariously flashed up on viewers’ screens. All was going well during her segment for BBC Scotland on Wednesday lunchtime, until this happened: Quamer couldn’t help laughing at the blunder, and then continued chuckling each time she turned away from the camera. To make matters worse, the show’s graphics team put up another erroneous caption as Quamer handed off to anchor Catriona Shearer. The clip has gone viral, and appears to have gone down well on Twitter: Brilliant 😂👌🏼 Best weather report I've ever heard . . . & I live in south west of England . . . X Quamer, meanwhile, is taking the blooper in stride: Oh look -my ride home after that crazy lunchtime broadcast! 🙈 #justjoking #fitsofgiggles #techfail #weatherpresenterfail @CatrionaShearer ❤️ pic.twitter.com/KpAKOFHIql
