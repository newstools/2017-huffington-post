South African Kwaito star Sipho ''Brickz'' Ndlovu has been sentenced to 15 years imprisonment in the Roodepoort Magistrate's Court. According to EWN, the musician had spent a month in jail before being released on R50,000 bail after making an application to the Johannesburg high court. Brickz was found guilty in June of raping a 17-year-old relative in November 2013. There were major delays in the trial as the defence was not ready to proceed with closing arguments. According to News24, Ndlovu was arrested and charged with assault after he allegedly threatened to kill his partner in 2015. This is a developing story.
