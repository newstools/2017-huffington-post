South African Tourism in Australia's "Come Home Bru" campaign cheekily compares national treasures in the two countries in a bid to get Saffers Down Under to "Come home (even if just for a holiday)". 


                                                                


    
      Durban-born comedian Robbie Collins appears in the official South African Tourism AU video, which has now gone viral, and, with his tongue firmly jammed into his cheek, draws comparisons between beer prices, barbies and braais -- and shows that there's just no way the views from Ayers Rock measures up to those from our own Table Mountain.  The campaign also involves a competition offering expats the chance to win a trip back home, for themselves and an Aussie "mate".

      Braai Expats have also been invited to bring their Aussie friends to authentic South African braai events to be held in Sydney and Perth as part of the Come Home Bru campaign. 


                                                                            


    
      Braai vs BBQ 


                                                                


    
      So if you're down Down Under, tired of "cookouts" and longing for a real South African braai, then, well, come home, bru.
