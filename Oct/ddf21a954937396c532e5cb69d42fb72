When you think of vegetarian or vegan dining, probably the burger-and-McNugget-heavy McDonald’s is hardly the first place to come to mind. But that may be about to change — at least for people in Finland. The fast-food chain is testing out a vegan burger — the “McVegan” — at one of its locations in Tampere, Finland. The burger, which includes a soy-based patty, will be available at the location from Oct. 4 through Nov. 21, according to Business Insider. Several vegan burger enthusiasts have already posted photos of the sandwich on social media. McDonald’s did not immediately respond to a request for comment from HuffPost. However, a representative told Today that the company does not have any plans to sell the McVegan outside of Finland.   The chain already offers some vegetarian burger options internationally, in countries including Germany and India. This article has been updated to note that McDonald’s offers vegetarian burgers in other countries. Share this slide:
