ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe believes that, if the country's top post is not handed down to Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa come the party's national conference in December, the ANC will fall into "crisis". In a series of tweets on Tuesday night, Mantashe said if President Jacob Zuma's succession is not "managed properly", the results may be "disastrous".   Suggesting a female deputy to Ramaphosa, it is likely that Mantashe was hinting at Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma for second place -- which entrenches the idea of a unified slate including members of both camps to avoid a contest in December.
