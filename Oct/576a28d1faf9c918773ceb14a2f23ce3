A massive data bank containing millions of South Africans' personal information -- including property ownership, income and employment history -- has been discovered by information security researcher Troy Hunt, Tech Central revealed on Tuesday.

The massive data breach is also said to contain more than 30-million unique South African ID numbers, according to Hunt, who is the founder of HaveIBeenPwned.com.  According to Tech Central, the data drove was discovered among a large bank of other data breaches and the source can be identified as South African, based on the personal address details contained in the trove.

Hunt says once the owner of the data is identified, he will upload the information to HaveIBeenPwned.com. According to Tech Central, some of the data headers suggest the source may be government or a commercial entity, although this remains unconfirmed.
