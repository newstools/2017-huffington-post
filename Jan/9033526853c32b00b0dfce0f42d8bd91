Don't mess with Mama Teigen. A Twitter troll recently went after Chrissy Teigen's support of immigrants following President Donald Trump's executive orders on immigration and refugees last week, saying that instead of donating money to the American Civil Liberties Union, Teigen should welcome "these people" into her home. The 31-year-old star swiped back, saying that she already has an immigrant living in her home: her own mother, Vilailuck Teigen. I do. She lives with me. She's my mom. https://t.co/3cYT21DXj3 You deleted it but don't worry @shigeo1, I got you. pic.twitter.com/d2LGNfb33Z Vilailuck is from Korat, Thailand.

"Los Angeles is the home of so many immigrants, so many creative people, so many dreamers, and those of us who work in this business have the privilege of shaping how the rest of the world perceives this country we love," he said, urging those in the room to continue fighting injustice. "We are the voice, we are the face of America. Our America is big, it is free, and it is open to dreamers of all races, all countries, all religions. Our vision of America is directly antithetical to that of President Trump. I want to specifically, tonight, reject his vision and affirm that America has to be better than that." Legend wasn't the only star to speak up at the SAG Awards: Ashton Kutcher and Mahershala Ali did as well, among others.
