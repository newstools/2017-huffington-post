First lady Michelle Obama has taken "one last walk" through the White House. Obama posted a short video to her Twitter account on Wednesday showing her wandering through "the People's House" with her family's two dogs, Bo and Sunny. Obama posted a photo with the two pups on Tuesday, thanking people for wishing her a happy birthday. The Obamas will leave Washington, D.C. Friday after President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration and travel to Palm Springs. Upon returning to D.C., the Obamas will live in the Kalorama neighborhood.
