Celebrity makeup artist Hung Vanngo has blessed the faces of stars like Karlie Kloss, Lily Aldrige and Emily Ratajkowski with his beauty expertise. Most recently, he uploaded an Instagram photo of his look for Selena Gomez that has created quite the stir among fans, with some claiming the image was altered. If you look closely at the bottom left of the wall in the photo, it appears to be warped. While it certainly appears to be ~somewhat~ Photoshopped or tampered with, it seems like an odd part of the photo to edit in the first place. After all, it’s just a wall? The makeup artist also once shared a photo comparing an unedited photo of Gomez in makeup with an edited one, proving the pop star looks gorgeous either way. Regardless, Gomez looks absolutely stunning and we’re loving her lob (long bob) hairdo. Work it, girl. Share this slide:
