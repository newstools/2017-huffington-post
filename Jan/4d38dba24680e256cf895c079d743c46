Ashley Graham is a trailblazer, working tirelessly to shift the standards of beauty in the fashion industry and beyond. She's also a supermodel blessed with good looks that land her in ultra glamorous magazine spreads, covers and advertisements. And that's why it's refreshing and exciting to see Graham share images that encourage everyone to love their body as it is, "thick thighs," "cellulite" and all. I workout. I do my best to eat well. I love the skin I'm in. And I'm not ashamed of a few lumps, bumps or cellulite.. and you shouldn't be either. #beautybeyondsize #lovetheskinyourein A photo posted by A S H L E Y G R A H A M (@theashleygraham) on Jan 25, 2017 at 6:41pm PST Graham posted an beach photo from the Philippines on Instagram on Wednesday. But it wasn't the typical glamour shot we've grown accustomed to seeing on her page, it was a photo of just her lower body. "I workout. I do my best to eat well. I love the skin I'm in. And I'm not ashamed of a few lumps, bumps or cellulite.. and you shouldn't be either. #beautybeyondsize #lovetheskinyourein," she captioned the photo. Just a day earlier, she posted a shot in what appears to be the same swimsuit, looking equally as gorgeous. ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­ A photo posted by A S H L E Y G R A H A M (@theashleygraham) on Jan 23, 2017 at 8:55pm PST Get you a hero who can do both.
