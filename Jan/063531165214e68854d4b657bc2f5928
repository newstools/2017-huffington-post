AmaBhungane reported on News24 that the African National Congress is the subject of a lawsuit after it failed to pay a public relations company tasked with helping to set up a covert propaganda campaign to discredit opposition parties in last year's local government elections. "A covert team, initially known as the War Room, intended to 'disempower DA and EFF campaigns' and set a pro-ANC agenda using a range of media, without revealing the ANC's hand. As traditional election campaigns lose their impact with voters, political parties are increasingly turning to more subtle methods, using everything from fake news to paid Twitter accounts to manipulate voter sentiment," amaBhungane reported. If it is true that @MYANC is behind this false poster through their covert operations, then it's violation of Electoral Rules #paidtwitter pic.twitter.com/zQy3LaXii5  "For the War Room this included a seemingly independent news site and chat show, using 'influencers' on social media, and planning to print fake opposition party posters. "However, a scathing close-out report attached to the court application claims the initiatives were either short-lived or stillborn due to mismanagement and a lack of funding," said the report.
