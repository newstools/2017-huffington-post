AmaBhungane reported on News24 that the African National Congress is the subject of a lawsuit after it failed to pay a public relations company tasked with helping to set up a covert propaganda campaign to discredit opposition parties in last year's local government elections. "A covert team, initially known as the War Room, intended to 'disempower DA and EFF campaigns' and set a pro-ANC agenda using a range of media, without revealing the ANC's hand. As traditional election campaigns lose their impact with voters, political parties are increasingly turning to more subtle methods, using everything from fake news to paid Twitter accounts to manipulate voter sentiment," amaBhungane reported.  "For the War Room this included a seemingly independent news site and chat show, using 'influencers' on social media, and planning to print fake opposition party posters. "However, a scathing close-out report attached to the court application claims the initiatives were either short-lived or stillborn due to mismanagement and a lack of funding," said the report.  The case, brought in the Johannesburg High Court by PR practitioner Sihle Bolani for an unpaid R2.2 million, implicates several high-profile ANC people, including ANC general manager Ignatius Jacobs, Minister in the Presidency Jeff Radebe, ANC-linked businessman Joseph Nkadimeng and activist Shaka Sisulu.  On Tuesday the high court declined to hear the case on an urgent basis, however it will still be heard at a later stage.  The ANC published a statement rejecting the allegations. Sisulu also denied it on Twitter.   Twitters readers became a little impatient with Sisulu's lack of response.  @ShakaSisulu Anc left you under the bus now u r on your own xem   @ShakaSisulu Explain in your own statement, bearing in mind @MYANC has already denied endorsing your actions  @ShakaSisulu waiting for the receipts pic.twitter.com/KjbFS7kkIt  @ShakaSisulu answer questions shortly he says .. pic.twitter.com/6zRWAkUzMf  And in turn, Sisulu became a little impatient with those responders.
