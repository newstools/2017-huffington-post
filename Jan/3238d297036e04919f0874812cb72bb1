Gone are the days of pretending you "woke up like this". In recent years more celebrities have been opening up about their health and fitness routines. With the new year well and truly settled in, these local celebs have jumped back onto the wellness saddle and are serving workout inspo on their social media feeds. Celebrity chef Siba Mtongana has taken her fitness regime to her Instagram feed. The mom of three — including her newest addition, 11-month-old daughter Buhle — makes sure to fit in workouts wherever she can and rates skipping and running as her top exercises. She didn't let the December festive break get the better of her and included hikes and seaside runs in her activities. #EarlyMorningRun done! ✅🏃🏾‍♀️🏋🏽‍♀️ #wellness #fitness #balance #exercise #run #activelife #impilo #gijimathings #slyza #commitments #letthedaybegin A photo posted by Siba (@sibamtongana) on Jan 15, 2017 at 9:29pm PST  No skipping of exercise this morning... #SkippingRope #3000times #InSets #Ugqaphu #Exercise #workout #wellness #fitness #activelife #balance #impilo 🏃🏾‍♀️🏋🏽‍♀️❤️ A video posted by Siba (@sibamtongana) on Jan 8, 2017 at 11:35pm PST  Saw this and was so inspired: When you RUN alone, it's called RACE.

The funny man and dad of two, who has spoken out about his former drug addiction, recently announced that he was quitting smoking as he continues on his wellness journey.

A photo posted by Unstagram (@unathi.co) on Dec 12, 2016 at 8:25pm PST Actress and presenter Amanda du-Pont has earned her position as a fitness model by consistently putting in the hours at the gym. Du-Pont boxes and does bodyweight training to mix up her workout routine. If her amazing abs and legs aren't inspiration enough, knowing that she's had to put in hundreds of hours to achieve them is even greater encouragement.

Nyovest, the self-proclaimed "sexy, chubby n**ga" who strutted his dad bod with pride, is a great example of the power of setting goals. He worked up a sweat last year and dropped the extra weight in the run-up to his Fill Up Orlando Stadium performance in October 2016. New week!!! New goals!!! New Single!!!

I'm only getting started!!! No where near my goal but I'm proud of myself!!! Check me out in 6 weeks!!! Getting ready for #FillUpOrlandoStadium A photo posted by Refiloe Phoolo 🇿🇦 (@casspernyovest) on Sep 7, 2016 at 3:07am PDT While recent studies have shown that posting about your workouts makes you "a narcissist", these celebs seem to be of the earlier school of thought that social networks can provide a good motivator to get back into the swing of things. Now, where did I leave my running shoes?
