TV personality and social media superstar Maps Maponyane is in Italy for Milan Fashion Week, enjoying European winter wonders. The Tweleb has made sure everyone knows where he is by sharing pictures of himself in Milan with Anna Zenga, president of Fondazione Zegna and image consultant of Group Zenga, as well as with 80-year-old model and actor Wang Deshun, in addition to lovely holiday pics at the Florence Cathedral and of himself walking in the snow. We're a little jealous. I have had the honour of spending quite a bit of time with Anna Zegna in Milan the last couple days and have learned a lot. The way she communicates is admirable and her style is 🔥🔥🔥 #Zegna #Menswear #FashionWeek #Fashion #Style #Suits #MFW #Milan A photo posted by Maps Maponyane (@mmaponyane) on Jan 14, 2017 at 12:38am PST  Got to meet China's acting and modeling grandfather at the age of 82, the great Wang Deshun 🙌🙌🙌 #Menswear #FashionWeek #Fashion #Style #Suits #WangDeshun #MFW #Milan A photo posted by Maps Maponyane (@mmaponyane) on Jan 14, 2017 at 3:44am PST ❄❄❄❄🇮🇹 A photo posted by Maps Maponyane (@mmaponyane) on Jan 12, 2017 at 11:08pm PST In pic
