The fashion industry seems to be moving in the right direction this year, with campaigns from some of the biggest brands featuring diverse casts. From an industry that has come under fire for its lack of minority representation on runways and in editorial shoots, the latest work being presented by the likes of Miu Miu, Saint Laurent and Dior may be setting a new representative standard. In the last two weeks, several campaigns have caught our eye on the diversity front. We've rounded them up for your here. thank you so much to academy my production company for helping me create this vision, and also to Rina for being the sickest dp ever... @academyplus @the_rinayang @dutty_pictures @dom________________ A video posted by FKA twigs (@fkatwigs) on Jan 12, 2017 at 6:42am PST Do you believe in more?

But beneath the sunny surface, "Suddenly Next Summer" continues Miu Miu's interrogation of contemporary femininity and nebulous terms like actor, it girl, model, and celebrity.

This year, Hollywood's Golden Globes recorded the higher number of black nominees and winners and a more diverse list of nominees is expected for this year's Academy Awards. We are definitely here for better representation once the 2017 fashion week season starts in February.
