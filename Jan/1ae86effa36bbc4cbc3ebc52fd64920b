The Obamas have escaped the land of Trump to enjoy some much-deserved time in paradise. The Virgin Islands Daily News reports Barack and Michelle Obama landed at Terrance B. Lettsome International Airport at 8:47 p.m. Monday night to start a holiday at Necker Island, billionaire Richard Branson's private getaway. Necker Island is 74 acres of white-sand paradise in the British Virgin Islands, complete with Balinese villas and infinity pools. A maximum of 30 guests can stay at the eco-friendly resort, staffed by 100 employees, with rates starting at $78,000 per night (about R1,2 million) for a full island buyout, according to Coastal Living. There's kite surfing, scuba diving, zip-lining and spa treatments for days. The Obamas reportedly flew in on Branson's private jet from their brief post-inauguration stop in Palm Springs, California. Before being whisked to their luxury locale from the airport, they apparently posed for a photo with immigration officers and the local police commissioner, Michael Matthews.
