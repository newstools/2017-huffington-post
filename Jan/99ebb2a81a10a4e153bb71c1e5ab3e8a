January is never going to win an award for best month of the year - the party's over, you're close to bankrupt and there's not even Christmas to distract us. But spare a thought for those whose birthday falls in the first month of the year, for they are the the heroes, tasked with rallying party spirit when all we want to do is hibernate.  You cheapskate peasants with your mini toiletries.  Can we redeem an IOU later in the year?  No one will come out for your birthday.  Do you see that stopping me?  I've had it with you people.  FML.  No. More. Calories.  Excuse me, Jesus has had his birthday people.  How do we arrange a second birthday?
