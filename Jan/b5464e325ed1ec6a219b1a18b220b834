Paparazzi are frequently under fire for crossing lines and testing boundaries with their subjects, but what they did most recently to Chrissy Teigen was too far. This was despicable. According to a series of tweets by the model, she and her husband, musician John Legend, were approached by paparazzi while leaving JFK airport in New York. After answering the paparazzi's questions (some were about cooking, Teigen wrote), one allegedly came out with an awful racial slur: She elaborates in her follow-up tweets, describing the event in brief: She also mentioned an anti-Semitic comment the man made to her and her husband as well: Teigen's incredulousness was shared by fellow users on Twitter, with many responding that she should've fought back. The model and mom responded to one comment, writing in a tweet, "Nah. They live for that photo and lawsuit." Teigen was unclear who the offensive man was, but postured that they'd find him when the video is released. Here's hoping justice is served and that paparazzo is found. This behavior is unacceptable. Teigen and Legend (and human beings in general) deserve better.
