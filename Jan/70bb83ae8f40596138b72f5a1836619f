People across the country came together Monday evening to mourn those who lost their lives in a shooting at a Quebec City mosque.

In Quebec City, thousands gathered outside the Islamic Cultural Centre to show support for the loved ones of six men who were killed and 19 who were injured while attending an evening prayer on Sunday.
