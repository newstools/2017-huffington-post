We've talked about rose gold hair, unicorn hair and hidden rainbow hair, but there's a new trend on the rise and it's "blorange" hair. Think strawberry blonde, but cooler. (Blonde plus orange.)

Further experiments in blorange thanks @alexbrownsell A photo posted by Georgia May Jagger (@georgiamayjagger) on Oct 5, 2016 at 5:05am PDT It it pink? Is it peach? Honestly, we're not even sure, but Instagram is starting to see an influx of blorange selfies, and we have admit, this unique hair shade looks dope.
