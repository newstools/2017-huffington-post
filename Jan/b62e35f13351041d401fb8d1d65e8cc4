Sunday's episode of the Mzansi Magic show "Date My Family" caused a social media scandal after a seemingly straightforward love story was upended by the revelation that there was a secret baby mama in the picture. Atang Letoalo charmed his way into the heart of Onthatile Khunou, positioning himself as a sweet guy who had been single for several months and was in search of love. But after the episode aired there were claims on Twitter that he already has a girlfriend, who is pregnant with his child. Several screengrabs of WhatsApp conversations between Letoalo and his alleged baby mama, Dineo, began to circulate. Screengrabs of conversations between Dineo and her friends also did the rounds. @Innomatijane all the girls impregnated by Atang Letoalo need to know #Datemyfamily #DMF @maxolie_ngidi pic.twitter.com/BK3O3vEOUo  One screengrab reads "What the fuck is Atang doing on Date my family when you're about to have a baby?" to which the response, presumably from Dineo, reads "I can't stop crying now I don't know what to think." Some just couldn't handle the drama that was unfolding after the credits had done rolling.
