Meryl Streep's poised and headline-making takedown of President-elect Donald Trump had Twitter users wondering one thing Sunday night: Which 140 characters would the president-elect use when he responded? Based on past performances, folks predicted everything from Trump's response to the time he would probably tweet his message. Let me beat you to it @realDonaldTrump - "Dishonest Meryl Streep never was good at that acting thing. What is empathy? Don't need it. Sad." Going to bed now so I can be ready to cover the likely 5 am Trump tweet on Meryl Streep. "Terrible Speech!" "Overrated!" #GoldenGlobes TRUMP 4:46 am: Hey Meryl, more like "The Devil Wears the Jacqueline Smith collection from KMart." I'm a TOTAL billionaire. You're not. SAD! Can't wait for Donald Trump to tweet about how Meryl Streep is overrated Meryl Streep, what a loser. No way she could've played Chachi. She'll never work again! Sad! Trump is especially fond of hitting back by calling people overrated.

Not sure that's gonna work with Meryl Streep's career. pic.twitter.com/IqdBZVBD6C @DanaSchwartzzz "empathy is a hoax created by the Hollywood elite"-Trump @DanaSchwartzzz Time to build a wall around Hollywood. A great big beautiful wall. And when I say big, folks, I MEAN big. Big like in YUGE. 'I may disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death my right to disparage it in 140 characters or less." trump gonna reference "death becomes her" in his 6am meryl streep tweet I bet Donald Trump tweets tomorrow that Meryl Streep is ugly so who cares what she thinks anyway. #GoldenGlobes Though Trump had not yet shared his reaction on Twitter, the president-elect responded to Streep's speech in a brief telephone interview with The New York Times early Monday, calling the acclaimed actor a "Hillary lover." Donald Trump said he was "not surprised" to be criticized by "liberal movie people" at the Golden Globes https://t.co/qvkjrhayJT
