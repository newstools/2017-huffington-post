Whether you first came to love her as Aibileen Clark in "The Help", or couldn't get enough of Professor Annalise Keating in "How To Get Away With Murder", Viola Davis' Hollywood star has been on the rise for a while now, but it seems Tinseltown is only just waking up to her true power. At the 74th Golden Globes on Sunday, Davis added another award to her mantel, when she took home the Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture for her role in "Fences".  Davis was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk Of Fame just last week, we have long wanted to walk in her famous footsteps. Here are some of the things we love most about the stage and screen star. 1.
