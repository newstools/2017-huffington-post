Generation Z, often referred to as the iGeneration, is the demographic cohort born after millennials, so they were born from the mid-1990s to the early 2000s. Twitter brought us to our knees with the following tweets about how old someone born in 2005 is in 2017. A kid born in 2005 is now 20 years old. Let that sink.  Okay. Hold up!  It gets even better... @sandalshagger LMAAOOO HOWS HE 20 YOU WILD, HE 18 AT MAX  @pakitrump you mean 12, right?  @MishaalNaeem 2005- 2017 do the math its 18 years  LMAO...
