  These days, it takes a very special occasion for Kim Kardashian to leave her home and join the world of social media. But being the doting friend she is, the reality star has come out of her self-imposed seclusion to meet the newborn twins of her good friend and makeup artist, Joyce Bonelli. Kardashian made a visit to the hospital where Bonelli was staying last week to give the baby boys their "first kiss" and pose for a series of black-and-white photos, which Bonelli compiled into an adorable Instagram video.

Just this week, she made an appearance at the family's annual Christmas party, posing for the camera in her sisters' many Snapchats and Instagram photos throughout the night. A few days later, husband Kanye West took to Twitter to share the family's holiday portrait with children North and Saint, which has put divorce rumours surrounding the couple to rest, for now at least.
