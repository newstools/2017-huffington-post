We all know how many attempts it takes to get the perfect photograph worthy of being uploaded to Instagram. But surely when you make a career out of looking fabulous in a bikini, you don't suffer the embarrassing faux pas the rest of us do? Australian Instagram model and sustainable fitnesswear brand Slinkki, Pia Muehlenbeck decided to shatter that illusion when she shared a before and after pictures of her posing on a beach in the Maldives.

But instead of resigning the blooper shot to the delete folder, the German-born model decided to share it with her fans on her Twitter page. ... the ocean has a mind of its own ðŸ˜‚ pic.twitter.com/f0f08rHyxo With the caption "the ocean has a mind of its own" Muehlenbeck is clearly not afraid to laugh at herself. However, she was social media savvy enough to only share the final picture-perfect snap with her 1.6 million Instagram followers. A girl after our own heart.
