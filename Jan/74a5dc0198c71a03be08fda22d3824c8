Tired of unsuccessful auditions, Thulasizwe Dambusa took matters into his own hands by posting video skits on his social media accounts. Now, with 60,000 followers on Instagram alone, he's made a name for himself as Babes Wamaleyvels without the help of his famous sister, Khanyi Mbau. According to The Times newspaper, 18-year-old Dambusa (whose goes by @Lasizwe on social media), researched popular vloggers and used their methods to draw a following. He created three alter-egos - Dimima, Candy and Stacy - and, through them, comments on current affairs, pop culture and "cultural and racial stereotypes", says The Times.

But in posts about Mbau, he calls her his "support structure" and says she has always been there for him. "I love my sister more than life itself," he wrote on Instagram. I love my sister more than life itself and thats a fact😓 Shes been there for me all my life #MySupportStructure Thru It All you will always be my Day 1 💐.

The self-made star was a guest at the MTV Africa Music Awards 2016, was featured on Vuzu Amp and on MTV Base's Newsish and is becoming a real household name.
