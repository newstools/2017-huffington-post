Molemo 'Jub Jub' Maarohanye has only been out of prison for a day and he's already trended on Twitter three times for three different reasons. First it was about his parole, then his newly released song and now, South Africa's #NoChill train has come to pick him up for a ride. Maarohanye spent four years in prison after he was convicted of culpable homicide for killing four school kids in a drug- and alcohol-fueled drag race. Much has changed since 2012 and Twitter's decided to let him know what he's missed out on.  #ThingsThatJubjubDoesntKnow..Generations is now Generations The Legacy, Jomo Sono is Dr Jomo Sono, Kaiser Chiefs is now an English Academy. #ThingsThatJubjubDoesntKnowBlack twitter has been fighting for him during the Oscar Pistorius trial ðŸ˜‚ #ThingsThatJubJubDoesntKnow Data has become so expensive we've had to stop asking for nudes. #ThingsThatJubJubDoesntKnow That stealing clothes that drying on a washing line is now called " online shopping " Nandos is now selling golden chickens, you need your entire salary to buy 1 full chicken #ThingsThatJubJubDoesntKnow #ThingsThatJubJubDoesntKnow Ricky Rick's diet now consists of cotton. #ThingsThatJubJubDoesntKnow That Babes Wodumo gets paid R100k just to walk around on stage like an invigilator There is a Shebeen in Saxonwold, ran by a Moreki from India #ThingsThatJubJubDoesntKnow #ThingsThatJubJubDoesntKnowBlessers Zuma paid back the moneyJulius Malema Lost weight Zulu people wanna kill Van Damme ðŸ˜‚ That Sista Betina is still going strong ðŸ˜› #ThingsThatJubJubDoesntKnow #ThingsThatJubJubDoesntKnow Real Soilders Are Now Afraid To Leave Their Uniform On The Washing Line...
