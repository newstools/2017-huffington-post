The ANC was hit with public scorn on Thursday night when the hashtag #DontfillupOrlando trended on Twitter. The subject appeared to have gained traction after EFF leader Julius Malema tweeted on Thursday: "If you are young and find yourself at Orlando Stadium on Sunday, then you are a traitor, the unemployed and the poor in Soweto must stay at home." The ruling party would hold its 105th anniversary celebrations at Orlando Stadium in Soweto this weekend. President Jacob Zuma would deliver what was expected to be his last January 8 statement. The ANC was expected to elect new leaders at its national conference in December. Twitter users attacked the party for the country's high unemployment rate, poor infrastructure at schools, its relationship with the controversial Gupta family, the 783 corruption charges looming over Zuma, and the taxpayer money used to upgrade his Nkandla homestead.

In April last year, the party was left red-faced when it failed to fill Nelson Mandela Bay stadium for its local government election manifesto announcement. -- News24Wire
