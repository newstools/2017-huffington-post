Missy Elliott is back with her first new single ― "I'm Better," featuring Lamb ― since 2016's collaboration with Fall Out Boy for the new "Ghostbusters" theme song. She also released a more proper single around this time last year ― "Pep Rally" ― in conjunction with a Super Bowl advertisement. Elliott announced the track on Twitter at midnight Friday.

At this point in her career, Elliott is a bonafide legend, and here she successfully brings her own skill-set to what may be a slightly derivative approach. It's fitting that Migos also dropped new music Thursday night with an announcement on Twitter ― although they had Kanye West start off their promotional cycle.
