Less than a week after DJ Black Coffee was robbed near his home in Johannesburg, another local celebrity has been a victim of crime. J'Something (real name João Fonseca), lead singer of the band Mi Casa, posted on his Instagram profile that his car had been broken into and that some items were stolen from it. Been a weird day. But yet a good day. Our car got broken into and they took some Japanese bowls we bought and some other things. Anyway. At least we fine. Nothing that can't be replaced. Just arrived at our friends house and tonight we catch up and unwind. Oh we had Snoekies for lunch ... amazing fish and chips in Hout Bay. Was insane. As a conclusion to this babble ... it could've been worse. It could always be worse. Big hug to you all.

The musician expresses that he is grateful at he and his family are "fine" and had snoek for dinner with friends in Hout Bay. J'Something won the GQ Best Dressed Man award in 2015. Part of his prize was driving off in a brand new Mercedes Benz G-Wagon which retails for R2,5 million, the vehicle of choice for the Kim and Khloe Kardashian, Bonang Matheba and Somizi Mhlongo. I can't believe this ... Life you are so good to me! My dream come true ... G Wagon Baby!!! Thank-you @mercedesbenzsa & @gqsouthafrica ;) A photo posted by J'Something™ (@jsomethingmusic) on Dec 15, 2015 at 2:32am PST  J'Something will continue his "foodie" vacation in the Mother City until the end of the week.
