Now that’s the way to celebrate the changing of a calendar. Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth locked lips for New Year’s Eve and posted the smooch to Instagram. In the widely circulated pic the “Wrecking Ball” singer and “The Voice” coach shared Sunday, the engaged-again pair kissed in front of an illuminated “happy new year” sign.

Thankfully, Cyrus posted this photo with the caption: “Sorry. My dude is HOT.” Sorry. My dude is HOT.
