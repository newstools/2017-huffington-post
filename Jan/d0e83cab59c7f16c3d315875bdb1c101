New Year celebrations around the world involved balloons, fireworks, celebrities... and kisses. In Ahmedabad in India, there were thousands of balloons. There were fireworks all around the world including in South America, Nigeria and even in war-torn Iraq. In New York, singer Mariah Carey headlined the Times Square celebrations. In Rome, the Pope led the New Year's Day mass. And also in New York, there was a new subway ride that was a century in the making, when the long-awaited Second Avenue line held a launch party below street level on Saturday night and the new line was open to the public from Sunday. In Taipei, Japan's table tennis Olympian Ai Fukuhara married Taiwanese table tennis Olympian Chiang Hung-chieh on New Year's Day. In London, the queen missed the New Year church service because she had a bad cold. Also in New York, a sign of the times was not just selfies, but selfies with the counter-terrorism task force. But of course, the long-standing tradition of New Year's kisses remained.                  In Rome, the Pope led the New Year's Day mass.   In Iraq, the war was briefly forgotten.   And of course, it wouldn't have been a New Year without those midnight kisses.
