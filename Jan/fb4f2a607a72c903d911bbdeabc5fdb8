International house DJ Nkosinathi Maphumulo AKA Black Coffee and actor Enhle Mbali Mlotshwa hosted their white wedding this past weekend and we have all the details from the glamorous event. The couple were married seven years ago in a traditional ceremony in KwaZulu-Natal. Huffington Post South Africa spoke to a guest that attended their white wedding, which took place in Sun City on 8 January 2017. The ceremony was set to take place in Sun City Amphitheater, outdoors. Due to the rain, the event had to be moved indoors to the area adjacent to where the wedding reception would take place. The ceremony was set to take place at 3pm, but the bridal part only began arriving at around 5pm. With former "Generations" actor Sophie Ndaba as the event planner, it was bound to be a dramatic and beautiful event. Ndaba created a beautiful ceremony area, with a space wasadorned with white drapes and roses. The aisle was a white carpet covered in rose petals. The pair's two children, Anesu and Asante, were accompanied by their nannies and were the first to walk down the aisle. They were followed by the groomsmen and the groom, who was escorted by his eldest son, Esona. 👥 💙💙 #FatherAndSon A photo posted by Jarred Doyle (@jarredlove13) on Jan 8, 2017 at 7:33am PST  The bride, dressed in a Gert Johan Coetzee couture gown, was accompanied by her mother, Bongi Mlotshwa.
