As South Africa grapples to make sense of information with an increase of fake news sites and paid Twitter accounts attacking media outlets, Media Monitoring Africa is warning consumers to be vigilant. The Huffington Post South Africa, Sunday Times and Talk Radio 702 were targeted by the fake news compilers over the weekend with inaccurate reports. Head of policy at Media Monitoring Africa Thandi Smith says there are 5 signs that people should be on the look out for. 1). Check the URL and make sure it is in line with the news page or media house. A fake news site can sometimes have a number in it instead of letters to create confusion. 2). Check the spelling of the account name. Although it might look legitimate, the accounts are often not spelled correctly, or have alternative spellings.

Smith also gave a handy guide to some of the known fake news sites to be on the lookout for:
