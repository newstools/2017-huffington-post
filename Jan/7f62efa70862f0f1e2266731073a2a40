While many enjoyed the show, he was heavily mocked and critiqued for his command of the English language. In a comment he told The Times: "I am not an English man and I won't change for anyone. I am an African man and I am proud of that. I was not born speaking English but I speak communicative English and that should be enough. People who speak to me understand me, so I don't think it is a problem." You tell them, Papa!
