Davis, who recently received a Golden Globe nomination for her performances in "Fences," is the first new star to be added to the Los Angeles landmark in the new year. "Viola is one of the actresses who always mesmerize fans with her talent. She is amazing and we are thrilled that she will grace our world famous Hollywood Walk of Fame," Walk of Fame producer Ana Martinez said in a press release last week. Davis's star ceremony took place on Thursday morning at the Walk of Fame, where actress Meryl Streep gave a speech and presented her with the honor. Accepting the honor, Davis expressed her deep gratitude, saying: "My life is good, thank you so much." Well deserved.
