Every award winner will receive R100 000 prize money. #MMA16  Black's debut album, "Amazulu", was released in November 2016 and was "a journey", she told IOL. "There are songs in there about me losing and finding myself, my knowing who I am and thriving, songs about heartbreak, love, being happy and comfortable in my skin; and all these are my stories," she said describing the 14-track album. Black received nominations in the categories for Best Afro Pop, Best Female, Best R&B, Best New Artist, and the prestigious Song of the Year.
