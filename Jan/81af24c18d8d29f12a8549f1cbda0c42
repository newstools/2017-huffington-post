Ah, the Golden Globes. You know, the “fun” award show, because the audience is allowed encouraged to drink while patiently waiting for the Hollywood Foreign Press Association to honor the very best in television and film. But unlike previous years, the famous crowd on Sunday won’t be drinking to dull the harsh comedic jabs. Ahead of the show, host Jimmy Fallon assured everyone that no one in the room should be nervous about anything he might say. While mean-spirited is far from Fallon’s brand of humor, he did tell The Hollywood Reporter that Donald Trump won’t escape his crosshairs. “The whole night won’t focus on [Trump], but it will be a week before the inauguration, so it will be on everyone’s mind,” he said. “It’s the first and maybe the last party that we’ll have in 2017.” The competition in the film category was fierce, but “La La Land” ended up sweeping the Globes and winning all seven awards for which it was nominated. On the television side, “The Night Manager” surprised all and was the night’s big winner, taking home three of the four awards for which it was nominated Check out the full list of winners below: Best Motion Picture, Drama”Hacksaw Ridge””Hell or High Water””Lion””Manchester by the Sea””Moonlight” ”20th Century Women””Deadpool””Florence Foster Jenkins””La La Land””Sing Street” Best Performance By an Actress in a Motion Picture, DramaAmy Adams, “Arrival”Jessica Chastain, “Miss Sloane”Isabelle Huppert, “Elle”Ruth Negga, “Loving”Natalie Portman, “Jackie” Best Performance By an Actress in a Motion Picture, Musical or ComedyAnnette Bening, “20th Century Women”Lily Collins, “Rules Don’t Apply”Hailee Steinfeld, “The Edge of Seventeen”Emma Stone, “La La Land”Meryl Streep, “Florence Foster Jenkins” Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture, DramaCasey Affleck, “Manchester by the Sea”Joel Edgerton, “Loving”Andrew Garfield, “Hacksaw Ridge”Viggo Mortensen, “Captain Fantastic”Denzel Washington, “Fences” Best Performance By an Actor in a Supporting Role in a Motion Picture Mahershala Ali, “Moonlight”Jeff Bridges, “Hell or High Water”Simon Helberg, “Florence Foster Jenkins”Dev Patel, “Lion”Aaron Taylor-Johnson, “Nocturnal Animals” Best Performance by Actress in a Supporting Role in a Motion PictureViola Davis, “Fences”Naomie Harris, “Moonlight”Nicole Kidman, “Lion”Octavia Spencer, “Hidden Figures”Michelle Williams, “Manchester by the Sea” Damien Chazelle, “La La Land”Tom Ford, “Nocturnal Animals”Mel Gibson, “Hacksaw Ridge”Barry Jenkins, “Moonlight”Kenneth Lonergan, “Manchester by the Sea” Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture, Musical or ComedyColin Farrell, “The Lobster”Ryan Gosling, “La La Land”Hugh Grant, “Florence Foster Jenkins”Jonah Hill, “War Dogs”Ryan Reynolds, “Deadpool” ”La La Land””Nocturnal Animals””Moonlight””Manchester by the Sea””Hell or High Water” Best Original Score, Motion Picture”Moonlight””La La Land””Arrival””Lion””Hidden Figures” Best Motion Picture, Animated”Kubo and the Two Strings””Moana””My Life as a Zucchini””Sing””Zootopia” Best Original Song, Motion Picture“Can’t Stop the Feeling,” “Trolls”“City of Stars,” “La La Land”“Faith,” “Sing”“Gold,” “Gold”“How Far I’ll Go,” “Moana” Best Motion Picture, Foreign Language”Divines””Elle””Neruda””The Salesman””Toni Erdmann” Best Television Series, Drama”The Crown””Game of Thrones””Stranger Things””This Is Us””Westworld” Best Television Series, Musical or Comedy”Atlanta””Blackish””Mozart in the Jungle””Transparent””Veep” Best Television Limited Series or Motion Picture Made for Television”American Crime””The Dresser””The Night Manager””The Night Of””The People v.
