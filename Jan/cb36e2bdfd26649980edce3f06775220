There are plenty of more pressing matters in the world to make sense of right now, but in the name of self-care, it's important to ponder the "whys" of some smaller, non-sensical happenings on the internet. Like, for example, the fact that people have been painting full faces of makeup on their thighs, and sharing them on Instagram. I didn't feel like doing makeup on my face so i did it on my thigh... Using the @morphebrushes pallet in 35c for the eyeshadow. Liquid eyeliner by @nyxcosmetics in black. For the eyebrows I used the @anastasiabeverlyhills brow pomade in chocolate. #morphebrushes #anastasiabeverlyhills #brows #glitter #makeuplook #makeuplover #makeupartist #makeup #motd #contour #eyebrows #darklips #creative #fleek #plum #highlight #eyelashes #gigirlarmy #underratedmuas #undiscovered_muas #slayagebeauties #makeupfeatures #makeme_vlog #beauty A photo posted by @privarelaxo on Oct 30, 2016 at 8:56pm PDT Teen Vogue spotted a phenomenon of people applying makeup on their upper thighs, and a quick Instagram search shows people are doing the same on their upper arms, as well. There's quite a bit of skill required to pull off some of these looks, but still ― we have to ask of the more than 1,000 Instagrammers who published arm makeup posts ... why?

Or, like the 100 layers videos and other odd beauty fads before it, perhaps the trend is just visually stimulating and fun to watch.
