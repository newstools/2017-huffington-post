"Hey, are these guys professional dancers?" That's what you may ask when first watching a group of Canadian Liberal Members of Parliament show off their dancing skills with an impromptu bhangra routine. But they're not, they're just regular ol' politicians.  Liberal MPs Navdeep Bains, Ahmed Hussen, Andy Fillmore and Scott Brison took a lesson from the Maritime Bhangra Group while in Halifax on Friday. The politicians apparently know a thing or two about breaking loose on the dance floor. Brison, who represents the Kings-Hants riding in Nova Scotia, shared a video of the lesson on Facebook, where users applauded them for embracing Canada's multiculturalism. "People of NovaScotia [sic] won't look at the man with turban as an alien anymore," commented a user named Vikramjit Singh. "Where else would Members of Parliament do this... Only in Canada," another wrote. Others were, well, less kind about the performance. "E for effort and enthusiasm," said Donna Crawford, advising Brison to keep his day job. This isn't the first time Canadian politicians have tried out bhangra. Earlier this month, Whitehorse mayor Dan Curtis took a lesson of his own and shared the video online. "I'm not that good at busting a move," he told The Huffington Post Canada at the time. Curtis also sported a turban for the event and called it an "enlightening" experience.
