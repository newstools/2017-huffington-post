The SAG Awards aired Sunday night in the midst of political turmoil (which fueled many speeches on the topic), but there was still quite a parade of fashion on the red carpet.

Check out our picks for best dressed of the night below, including one seriously dapper dude (Rami Malek), and then continue to the bottom of our page to see the slideshow including all of the red carpet looks.
