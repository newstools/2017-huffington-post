While the festive season is a chance to take a break and catch your breath after a busy year, for celebrities it can be incredibly busy - attending multiple parties in one night is work for some people, you know. So now that we're all slowly getting back into our routines, the likes of Somizi, Pearl Modiadie, Bonang and AKA have jetted off for much-needed time off. Ever-opulent media personality Bonang and rapper boyfriend AKA - who spent much of December in a private jet, being flown all over South Africa for gigs - settled into their first class seats to head off for some downtime in Thailand. .....another adventure begins!! 🌺🌞Ⓜ🐝📸 #PassportGang #Travel A photo posted by Bonang Matheba (@bonang_m) on Jan 7, 2017 at 10:56pm PST  Day Two.... 🌺😍❤ #Phuket #blackgirlmagic #MustBeThatAfricanButter #Travel A video posted by Bonang Matheba (@bonang_m) on Jan 9, 2017 at 10:35pm PST  HAPPY HOLIDAYS 🇹🇭🍾🌴🌊 A video posted by AKA (@akaworldwide) on Jan 9, 2017 at 9:05am PST  Heaven. 🌺😍🍾 A photo posted by Bonang Matheba (@bonang_m) on Jan 8, 2017 at 7:33pm PST He won't say where he is, but Somizi is taking a break from his crazy schedule in a private villa and time on the beach.
