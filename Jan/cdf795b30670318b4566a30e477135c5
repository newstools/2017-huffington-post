We’re standing with you, @WomensMarchSea, all the way in the other Washington! #SeaYouAtTheMarch #WomensMarch pic.twitter.com/i3I0D337eh Some members of Congress shared the personal reasons why they marched, including Reps. Diana DeGette (D-Co.) and Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), who marched with women from their districts. Rep. Jose Serrano (D-N.Y.) marched with his “sister,” Rep. Nydia Velazquez (D-N.Y.), and Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, the first Mexican-American congresswoman, said she marched for “all women.” Others sent messages of solidarity to the marchers, including Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Congratulations to the women marching today. We must go forward to ensure full reproductive justice for all women. #WomensMarch Kevin Donahue, Washington D.C.’s deputy mayor for public safety and justice, said organizers of the march estimated half a million people turned out for the event. Crowds also turned out to protest in other places around the world, including London, New York, Chicago and Antarctica.
