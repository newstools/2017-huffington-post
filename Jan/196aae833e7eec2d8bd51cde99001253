The festive season is over and your alarm is set for 6.45am. It feels like you were only there yesterday, but now your boss is expecting you back at your desk looking bright eyed and bushy tailed. Shame we're all still hungover from New Year's Eve. Here are 14 things we'll all be doing this week (and maybe next week too).  Just, give me a minute.  Locked out of your computer 'til lunch time.  It was shit, the same as yours.  Just so tired.  Every. Bloody. Time.  'My brain is just not working today.'  *Deletes all*  We don't want to ever see your face round here again.  Everything seems like a good idea in December.  WHY?  The cards, fairy lights, tinsel, and that half-eaten mince pie.  Who knew two weeks of central heating could do so much damage?  Because we are poor and fat.  We're not ready to be back here.
