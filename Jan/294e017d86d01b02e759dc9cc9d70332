After passing the torch to Donald Trump, former President Barack Obama is taking his family far away for some well-deserved R&R. Following this morning’s inauguration ceremony and customary helicopter ride to Andrews Air Force Base, everyone’s favorite first couple was spotted boarding a plane bound for sunny Palm Springs, California: Malia and Sasha are expected to join their parents in Palm Springs, where Obama made numerous trips for both work and play during his presidency. The family will likely lay low: Out Magazine reports they’ll be staying at the home of U.S. Ambassador to Spain James Costos in Thunderbird Heights, a hip collection of neighborhoods with its own golf course: A photo posted by Beth Ella Bedingfield (@ellabella2) on Apr 27, 2014 at 5:05pm PDT It’s anyone’s guess if Obama will hit the links during this trip to the Coachella Valley. He’s visited plenty of other courses in the area over the last few years, most recently PGA West. Obama told reporters he plans to get lots of sleep in his first few days out of office. But if the family should get restless, plenty of local adventures await. From resort pools to shopping to horseback rides and an aerial tram, the Palm Springs region is a perfect post-inauguration playground. Oh, and there’s not a Trump in sight. Rest up, Obamas!
