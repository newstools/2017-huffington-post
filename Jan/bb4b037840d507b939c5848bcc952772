If you watched the inauguration and found nothing to be happy about, let this be the bit of comedic relief that you needed. Former President George W. Bush struggled with a plastic rain poncho while trying to keep dry during President Donald Trump’s address. Naturally, the internet LOVED this epic battle of man vs. plastic sheet.
