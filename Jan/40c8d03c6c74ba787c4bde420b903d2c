The Sunday Times reported that former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe is in line for a cabinet position. The newspaper reported that the ANC in the North West wanted him added to the list of ANC members it wants in Parliament, paving the way for him to be an MP and possibly minister of finance. That ministry is a political hot potato, with control over the National Treasury an ongoing political battle. Molefe announced his resignation as Eskom CEO in November with effect from the end of December following the Public Protector's State of Capture report, which noted 58 phone calls between Molefe and Atul Gupta over six months, plus that cellphones indicated Molefe had repeatedly been in Saxonwold. A tearful Molefe had denied at an Eskom media briefing in November that he'd been in Saxonwold to visit President Jacob Zuma's friends the Guptas, saying there was a shebeen in the area. The "Saxonwold Shebeen" subsequently became the butt of social media jokes, as its whereabouts could not be established. On Sunday, Molefe could not be contacted and the ANC has not yet responded to a request for comment on the allegations. Whether it's true or not, social media had a good dig at Molefe's potential political career, including as "Moreki" or the person who buys the drinks.
