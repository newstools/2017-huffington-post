Judgment has been reserved in a high court case where civil rights organisations are challenging the "golden handshake" extended to former National Prosecuting Authority boss, Mxolisi Nxasana. Advocate Jeff Budlender, acting on behalf of Freedom Under Law, Corruption Watch and CASAC, is motioning for the court to declare the deal between President Jacob Zuma and Nxasana unlawful. The groups want Nxasana to be reinstated because they say he is entitled to the position from which he was removed.    In 2015, Zuma awarded Nxasana a R17-million settlement deal in exchange for vacating his office. This made way for the appointment of Shaun Abrahams. IOL reported that Judge President Dunstan Mlambo, who is leading the the full bench in the application, questioned whether it would be fair towards Abrahams to replace him with Nxasana. Advocate Hilton Epstein led arguments for the NPA.
