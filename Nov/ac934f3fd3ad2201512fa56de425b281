Ryan Reynolds had some fun with his wife, Blake Lively, after photos of the actress surfaced from the set of her new movie.  Over the weekend, paparazzi snapped pics of Lively in Dublin, Ireland, filming “The Rhythm Section,” in which she plays a woman seeking revenge after her family is killed in an orchestrated plane crash. The outfit for the role is certainly different from Lively’s typically glamorous ensembles, and Reynolds didn’t miss the opportunity for a joke.  Humor is certainly par for the course for the famous couple. Last month, Lively trolled Reynolds on his 41st birthday by posting an Instagram of another famous Ryan.  And, yes, he trolled her on her birthday, too.  Lively has talked about her husband’s social media presence in the past, particularly his tweeting habits, saying that he does run some of his posts by her before sharing them with his millions of followers.  “He may as well work for the Enquirer,” she previously told Glamour. “When he says ‘my daughter,’ he’s never, ever talking about her. Everything is a completely made-up scenario. He’ll run them by me sometimes just to make me laugh. But oh, I’m so in love with him when he writes that stuff. I mean, I’m in love with him most of the time, but especially with that.” All in good fun.  Share this slide:
