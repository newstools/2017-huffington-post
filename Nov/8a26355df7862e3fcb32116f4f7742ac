A video of Botswana president Ian Khama dancing allegedly to the news of Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe's resignation has gone viral on social media. It has since emerged that the video is fake. The video was posted on unverified Zimbabwean news websites Zimbabwe Today and iHarare.com. It gained traction when prominent Twitter users shared it on the social media platform.    It would appear that the video was in fact taken at an event earlier this year. Khama had previously written to Mugabe asking him "to do the honourable thing by voluntarily relinquishing power as the president of Zimbabwe" in an open letter published this week. In the hoax video, he was seen jumping up from his seat, reportedly while watching a live news broadcast of Mugabe's resignation.
