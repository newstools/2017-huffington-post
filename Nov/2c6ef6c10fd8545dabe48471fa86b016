LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - A South African woman who helps train women in self-defence was crowned Miss Universe on Sunday at the pageant held in Las Vegas, with Miss Colombia and Miss Jamaica also making it to the final three. Demi-Leigh Nel-Peters, 22, who unleashed a big smile when she won, hails from Western Cape province and recently earned a business management degree from North-West University. Her passion for self-defence was reinforced when she was hijacked and held at gunpoint about a month after winning her title as Miss South Africa, she said in a video on the Miss Universe website. Miss Colombia, Laura González, 22, was the first runner-up. She has been preparing to be an actress since the age of 16. After graduating from a performing arts school, she moved to Bogotá to build her career. The second runner-up was Miss Jamaica, Davina Bennett, 21. She is a model pursuing a degree in marketing at the University of the West Indies. Reporting by Jon Herskovitz; Editing by Clarence Fernandez
