A Navy crew that made giant sky drawings of penises while flying over Okanogan County, Washington, will be held accountable for their obscene actions, Navy officials said. The drawings appeared Thursday evening, quickly attracting attention from locals like Ramone Duran. Duran told the Spokesman-Review newspaper he was running errands when he saw a jet start to make designs in the sky with contrails. “After it made the circles at the bottom, I knew what it was and started laughing,” Duran said. “It was pretty funny to see that. You don’t expect to see something like that.” Some pilots at NAS Whidbey did some sky writing today. 🤦🏻‍♂️https://t.co/9IsYvkX1za pic.twitter.com/Lm7kpMhKpY Other people weren’t as excited. One mother told local station KREM she was upset the drawings might force her to have a conversation about male anatomy she wasn’t prepared for. The jet responsible for the contrail took off from the Naval Air Station Whidbey Island. Navy officials apologized for the obscene sky drawings in a statement to KREM: “The Navy holds its aircrew to the highest standards and we find this absolutely unacceptable, of zero training value and we are holding the crew accountable.” On Friday, Navy officials said the aircrew has been grounded pending a thorough investigation. Navy says air crew flew route to draw obscene air trail in Washington state. Navy "We have grounded the aircrew & are conducting a thorough investigation..we will hold those responsible accountable for their actions. The Navy apologizes for this irresponsible and immature act" Meanwhile, the Federal Aviation Administration told the station there’s nothing they can do unless there’s a safety risk, adding that the agency “cannot police morality.” Meanwhile, Mother Nature seems to have a saucy sense of humor as well, based on the gallery of cloud penises below.
