Police arriving at a car crash in western Canada found five naked people in the vehicle, and ended up accusing them of kidnapping a mother, her father and her baby. Royal Canadian Mounted Police Corporal Laurel Scott said the mother, baby and the woman's father had been taken from a home and forced into the vehicle against their will. While the car was being driven, the adult male, who was in the trunk, managed to escape. Shortly after that, the woman escaped with the baby. Authorities said a passer-by offered assistance, and secured all three in his truck –– before the suspects' vehicle rammed the rear of the truck, but ended up in the ditch. Three adults among the suspects remained in custody facing charges of kidnapping and resisting arrest, police said. The other two suspects were youths, who were released without charges. Officials said the three people who were kidnapped were not injured. The investigation continues, with officials believing drugs and/or alcohol might have been a factor. News24
