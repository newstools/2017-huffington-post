In recent weeks, you will have wondered where the phrase "yena a ya kwini?" comes from, what it means, and how you can use it. Wonder no more... The phrase was taken from a rant filmed and posted on Facebook. In the video, "July" is complaining about a family member who made false accusations about him and keeps spreading gossip about him. Speaking in XiTsonga, Buti MaJuliee, as he's affectionately known, asks "yena a ya kwini?", which, loosely translated, means where was she going (when she saw me doing the things she's accusing me of). Colloquially, when someone asks, "yena a ya kwini" they mean where was he/she going.   Although he was aware that he was being filmed, he had no idea his life was about to change for the better following the video, which has since gone viral. July has become an overnight sensation, scoring himself gigs both a singer and an on-stage entertainer.  He has also recorded and released a CD with Limpopo-based entertainer and media personality, Tirhani Mambasa. Ene va tsaka hey   Social media users have since adopted the phrase to use in real-life situations and it's hilarious. In true South African style, people have also been inspired to created songs asking, "yena a ya kwini?".   #Yenaayakwihi   So, next time you find yourself in a situation where you need to ask the million-dollar question, yena a ya kwini?, here are similar situations to guide you:       Yena a ya kwini??? ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ pic.twitter.com/9q2Ind8OQh
