Some music lovers are riveted by every note of an orchestra performance, while others use it as a chance to take a snooze.  If you’re in the latter camp, let this clip from California’s North State Symphony orchestra be a warning.  A woman apparently dozed off during a performance of “The Firebird” by Igor Stravinsky, only to wake up with a scream at the crash of a drum.  Much of the audience laughed, and even music director Scott Seaton smiled and snuck a quick look over his shoulder as he conducted the orchestra.  “Yes, Stravinsky can still be a surprise over a century later!” he later tweeted.  Check it out above.  H/T Mashable Share this slide:
