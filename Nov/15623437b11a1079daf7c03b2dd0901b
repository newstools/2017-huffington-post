"I thought about it because it's the festive season and men always cheat in the festive season because apparently, they go on "leave" [from relationships]. So the song is basically just to ask the question, 'This season who are you going to be cheating with?' and not to encourage [cheating]. Because apparently on November 30, your man will disappear and only come back on February 14," he told the publication. He said a music video for the song is due for release "very soon". Dambuza said he will also reveal his real bae in the video. Listen to the song here:  Dambuza joined SABC3's gossip show, "The Scoop" which saw him hanging out with celebrities on red carpets and parties. He also aced a slot on Tbo Touch's online radio station, TouchHD as a host. The 19-year-old also features on Babes Wodumo and Ntando Duma's new music video of the song, Jiva Phez'kombhede.
