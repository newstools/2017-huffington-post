Twenty-five loggerhead turtles will be released back into the sea in December, following months of rehabilitation. The Two Oceans Aquarium in Cape Town have an ongoing project in which they rescue stranded juvenile turtles that are swept down from the northern KwaZulu-Natal coast by the Agulhas Current and washed ashore. These turtles are often weak and dehydrated and are then rehabilitated by the aquarium and then released back into the ocean. "Juvenile loggerheads will be released back into the wild, together with Yoshi, the iconic Queen of the Aquarium. They will once again face the perils of the ocean –- but with a renewed chance at life," the aquarium's Renée Leeuwner announced. The rehab helps those in desperate need -- from 25g hatchlings to heavyweights, dehydrated turtles to those with broken shells and even picky eaters.
