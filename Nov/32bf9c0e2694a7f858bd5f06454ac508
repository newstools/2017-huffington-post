People have been stewing over the correct answer to a coffee-themed puzzle. A Twitter user shared the logic quiz, in which coffee is poured into a network of pipes leading to four different cups, on Thursday. You have to figure out which of the cups will receive coffee first: Letâ€™s see whoâ€™s brain works ðŸ˜­ who gets coffee first ? ðŸ‘€ðŸ¤” pic.twitter.com/CqCtIeKVsJ The brainteaser sparked plenty of debate: Isn't it 9, 4, 7, 5? (9 first because the distance between the tubes are much shorter than 4.) Only cup 9 will get coffee.... Wouldn't they all get it at the same time 9,4,5,7 It's # 9. 4. 9. 7. 5. 4 ðŸ¤” 4...9....7.....5 in that order Some people answered correctly, but many appeared to miss one key point. Warning: the answer is about to be revealed. A closer look at the pipes shows that the coffee will actually end up in only one cup â€• number 5. Thatâ€™s because the pathways to the other three cups are all sealed off, as another Twitter user illustrated here: Uhh, yes lol pic.twitter.com/ZJoEqk3qU0 Bravo to all those who nailed the challenge on their own.
