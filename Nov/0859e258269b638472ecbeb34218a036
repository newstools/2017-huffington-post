Television, in less than a century, has become inextricably entwined in our lives. Whole families get together to share their favourite shows, while the more adult stuff attracts dedicated clans of followers online. The digital age gives us access to internet streaming, too, which has led to the rise of ShowMax, Netflix and the like.
