Two-time Emmy Awards nominee and renowned South African comedian, Loyiso Gola, knows exactly what Thuso Mbedu is going through ahead of the 45th International Emmy Awards in New York in the U.S. Speaking to HuffPost SA, Gola said although awards come and go, Mbedu should delve into the experiences attached to the nomination.

She should just live in the moment of hanging out with other nominees, connecting with people who can assist her with her aspirations of furthering her career," he said. Gola added: "The point of life is to experience. At the end of the day, the awards are a business and so are you -- for one night you're intertwined, but after that, you're back on your own again and you must live. So absorb as much as you can, connect with as many people as you can and just enjoy every moment." Mbedu announced her nomination in September much to the delight of South Africans. She's been nominated for her role as Winnie on Mzansi Magic's drama series "Is'thunzi" in the Best Performance by an Actress category.
