      1. IRB Rugby World Cup -- 1995  Perhaps South Africa's biggest sporting achievement, after being banned from international sport for decades and with the memory of apartheid still fresh in the minds of all citizens, the 1995 Rugby World Cup may nevertheless have come to us too early. The explosive growth of the "Rainbow Nation" myth papered over cracks that needed instead to be excavated, investigated and repaired, before we could move forward properly. However, it was the biggest thing to happen to the country, and it resulted in even more euphoria when the Springboks did the unthinkable and beat New Zealand, uniting South Africans behind "amabokoboko". The legacy and impact that will be remembered most from the the 1995 World Cup, is the way Nelson Mandela believed in the team and their power to unite a divided nation. Winners: South AfricaðŸ‡¿ðŸ‡¦ South Africa is an attractive option for fans and visitors, and each host city will be showcasing the best they have to offer, from beaches to safaris, in 2023. We definitely think South Africa is more than ready to host another Rugby World Cup.
