It looks like November's climate patterns have delivered a twist as some provinces in South Africa should brace themselves for an expected snowfall this week. Read: 2017 On Track To Become One Of The Hottest Years Ever   Snow Report SA has said that snow will start falling in South Africa on Tuesday night in the Western Cape, Eastern Cape, Free State, KwaZulu-Natal as well as Lesotho. According to Traveller24 , by Wednesday afternoon, the snow is expected to have spread to the Drakensberg range in the Eastern Cape and by the evening it should hit surrounding towns.  The Ben Macdui mountains in the Eastern Cape should expect 40cm of snow from Wednesday morning, and Sani Pass could possibly get 50cm on Wednesday evening, while Thabana Ntlenyana in Lesotho should get almost 1m of snowfall.  "At the same time, snowfalls will commence throughout most of Lesotho, and into some high-lying areas around Kokstad and Matatielle, with light falls possible to come down into KwaZulu-Natal around Underberg and Himeville, and possibly even towards Bulwer by Thursday morning," says Snow Report SA.

This is because of a "steep upper air trough" that will result in "wet, windy and cold weather".
