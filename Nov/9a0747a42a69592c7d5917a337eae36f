South Africa is willing to act as a mediator in Zimbabwe's political crisis, said Clayson Monyela, spokesperson for the Department of International Relations. Monyela, who was speaking on Radio 702, said: "We will continue to monitor the situation in our capacity as the neighbouring country. As you know, Zimbabwe is where it is today because South Africa has consistently and regularly been part of the mediation process over the past years. So we are interested in what is going on... in the nation." Monyela said political challenges were best solved through dialogue: "South Africa is willing to be a mediator, we have done it before and based on the briefing we will decide the way forward." Monyela also urged SA citizens in Zimbabwe to maintain close contact with the SA Embassy. "SA citizens must maintain contact with the SA embassy, and also be careful."
