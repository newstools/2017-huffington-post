Of course, a lot of people on Twitter voiced their opinions about singer Blake Shelton being chosen People magazine’s Sexiest Man Alive for 2017. And aside from Shelton’s main squeeze, Gwen Stefani, many of them seem to have a completely different idea about who should have been honored with such a title. Like, oh, we dunno, a suave British actor who goes by the name Idris freaking Elba, perhaps? We mean, c’mon: While we leave to take a cold shower, here are some of the funniest pro-Elba tweets: Idris Elba is always hot but he was even able to make me sexually attracted to a fucking buffalo in Zootopia and if that’s not proof that he’s the sexiest man alive idk what is. Blake Shelton named sexiest man... Is it because Idris Elba is a mythical being that he wasn't nominated? pic.twitter.com/L84T5vWLO9 Can’t believe Blake Shelton is People’s Sexiest Man Alive when Idris Elba got 3 million more votes. Why did Idris Elba change his name to Blake Shelton? He's already an established actor so it's kinda weird but whatever... congratulations! pic.twitter.com/bsnu8wdcwk Well, you’ll be pleased to know that on Earth 2 where Hillary is POTUS, People’s sexiest man alive is Idris Elba Blake Shelton is going to spend his entire year as Sexiest Man Alive complaining about Idris Elba’s emails.
