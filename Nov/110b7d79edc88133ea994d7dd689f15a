KwaZulu-Natal, the Eastern Cape and Lesotho are experiencing snow on a normal spring day. This is the second time snow has fallen in South Africa and Lesotho during spring –– mountaintop residents of Lesotho and the Drakensberg were surprised with snowfall just last month. Here is the weird but wonderful phenomenon in pictures: It's 16 November & this is what the Bulwer area of #KZN looks like today. Rain is fast melting the #snow though. pic.twitter.com/34Vyv6wER0 Snow in the central Drakensberg at Premier Resorts Sani Pass pic.twitter.com/vD0ybbrsj2 Bushmans Neck Pass Lesotho.
