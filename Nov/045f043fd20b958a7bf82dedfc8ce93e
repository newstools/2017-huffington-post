The DA stands ready to interdict any attempt by Energy Minister David Mahlobo to "force through a nuclear deal despite the fact that South Africa does not need or afford the estimated R1-trillion deal," says the DA's energy shadow minister, Gordon Mackay. According to City Press on Sunday, officials in Mahlobo's department have been working weekends to finalise the country's reviewed integrated energy resource plan four months ahead of schedule.  The publication reported the plan to determine South Africa's "energy mix" would be finalised within two weeks despite expectations it would only be complete by February next year.
