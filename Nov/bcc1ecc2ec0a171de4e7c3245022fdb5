And in case you were wondering, chomi nayindoda:  Having watched Ntando during her reign as Miss South Africa in 2016, we're convinced that she will slay in her new role. Here's why: She lets her faith shine on social media Ntando has always spoken about how faith shapes her life and her relationship with God. This often comes across her on social media posts.  She can hold a tune She previously said singing was one of her hidden talents, and she's revealed in an interview that when she feels down, singing the gospel song "Kubo bonke oThixo" really cheers her up.  She's a dedicated follower of fashion It's an open secret that first ladies in the church die for fashion. With her fashion sense, Ntando is the perfect fit for the role.    
Congratulations once again to Ntando and Khaya.
