Everyone wants to look their best at weddings, but sometimes, the universe has other ideas. Thankfully, when Mike Tague inadvertently starred in a wedding photo fail, he took it in his stride. The New Yorker was an usher at his friend Amanda's wedding when the photographer snapped a distorted shot of him sitting behind a vase. Being a good sport, Mike decided to tweet the photo, joking: "Did I do something to offend the wedding photographer?" Mike was attending the wedding with his boyfriend, Andrew Mercier, and joked that he was pretty miffed his other half fared better in the photo. In fact, he created his own conspiracy about why the photographer took the bizarre picture, with a poll receiving more than 14,000 votes. 
Needless to say, people on Twitter found the whole thing hilarious.  Some (including Mike) compared the image to fictional characters. While others Photoshopped Andrew's head in the photo to make Mike feel better. Thankfully, Mike was able to see the funny side to the whole thing. "When I saw the photo, I felt very ugly for about three seconds and then realised my family and friends would probably crack up to see it," he told HuffPost UK. "But the reaction it is getting online has been tremendous." In case anyone was in any doubt, Mike later posted a second photo of himself and Andrew to prove he does indeed have a regular-sized head.
