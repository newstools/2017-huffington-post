SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, Texas ― The victims were as young as five and as old as 72.  At least 26 people lost their lives and 20 others were injured on Sunday in the worst mass shooting in the history of the state of Texas. A little before noon, a lone gunman opened fire on worshippers gathered at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, a small community near San Antonio.  Annabelle Renee Pomeroy, the 14-year-old daughter of pastor Frank Pomeroy, was among the first victims to be identified. Pomeroy and his wife were out of town at the time of the shooting. The heartbroken father described his daughter to ABC News as “one very beautiful, special child.” Several of the victims were members of a single family. Michael Ward told HuffPost that many of his family members were in attendance at the church when the tragedy took place. Ward said his young niece Emily was fatally shot. Emily’s five year-old brother Rylan was shot four times and her sister Brooke was injured as well. The siblings’ mother, Joanna, was also shot.   Nick Wagner, a photographer with the Austin American-Statesman who was on the scene shortly after the attack, reported that the father of Rebecca Metcalf was killed in the shooting.  Carrie Matula hugs Rebecca Metcalf after Metcalf's father was killed in a mass shooting at a church in Sutherland Springs, TX. pic.twitter.com/s5otmj8q4M This is a developing story, check back for updates.
