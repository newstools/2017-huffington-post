Tesla on Thursday night unveiled its electric semi truck, but the massive new vehicle was overshadowed by what it was hauling inside.  When the truck’s tailgate came down, out rolled a new and previously unannounced Tesla Roadster, which CEO Elon Musk called the fastest production car in the world.  “The point of doing this is just to give a hardcore smackdown to gasoline cars,” Musk said. “Driving a gasoline sports car is going to feel like a steam engine with a side of quiche.”   The base model will go from zero to 60 mph in 1.9 seconds, making it the first to hit that mark in under 2 seconds, and will go from zero to 100 mph in 4.2 seconds, making it the fastest in that category as well, Musk said.  The four-seat convertible will do the quarter-mile in 8.9 seconds, another record for a production car.  Musk didn’t give the top speed, but said it would be above 250 mph. The 200 kilowatt-hour battery pack would give it a range of 620 miles on a single charge, he said.  The car will be available in 2020 with a starting price of $200,000, which The Verge notes might be a bargain, as the only currently comparable cars on the market start at around $1 million.  Share this slide:
