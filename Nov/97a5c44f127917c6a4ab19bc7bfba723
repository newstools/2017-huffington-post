South African celebrities have come out in support of Cassper Nyovest and his dream to fill up the biggest stadium in Africa, FNB Stadium, come December 2. If he fills up the stadium, Cassper, whose real name is Refiloe Phoolo, will have staged the biggest local hip-hop concert history. Taking to Twitter at the weekend, the "Tito Mboweni" hitmaker said he could not do it on his own and called for people to buy tickets to the show.   Fans, music lovers and celebrities alike responded with messages of support with many putting their money where their mouth is:               Tickets for the show are available at Computicket. And we could not agree more with Vusi Thembekwayo.
