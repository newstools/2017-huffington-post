President Jacob Zuma is considering the matter from National Assembly Speaker on allegations against Minister. https://t.co/6DbNYk6sd0  This weekend The Sunday Times reported that it had seen an affidavit by Vanara in which he alleged that Bongo had offered him a bribe. According to the report, Bongo told Vanara he was instructed by Eskom's interim chairperson Zethembe Khoza to offer the bribe to derail the inquiry. Khoza originally denied the allegations to the newspaper. On Monday he reiterated in a statement that he has "never spoken to Mr Bongo, and I have never met him". Calls for probe On Monday the ANC in Parliament said it takes "serious exception to allegations of attempts to collapse this inquiry and derail the work of Parliament". It said it would support an investigation into the alleged bribe by Parliament's ethics committee. The DA on Sunday said it would write to Mbete to "demand protection for both members of the portfolio committee on public enterprises currently investigating allegations of state capture at Eskom as well as the witnesses appearing before the inquiry". The committee is not set to hear evidence this week, but will meet on Wednesday to assess what it has heard and consider how to proceed with its inquiry. -- Fin24
