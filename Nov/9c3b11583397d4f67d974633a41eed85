A new study shows that sheep have the ability to recognise human faces from photographs on computer screens.

It had been known for some time that sheep can recognise familiar faces of other sheep and of humans.

Lead scientist Professor Jenny Morton says sheep have advanced face-recognition abilities, comparable to those of humans and monkeys. Among the faces they were trained to recognise were Barack Obama and "Harry Potter" actress Emma Watson. The research was published in the "Royal Society: Open Science" journal. News24
