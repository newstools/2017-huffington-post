Most of us never knew that watching six contestants trying to climb a slippery staircase could be so compelling, but here we are in the upside-down we call 2017.  An episode from a Japanese game show featuring a set of slippery stairs appeared on YouTube this week, and it has captured the internet for good reason: the display of pure athleticism, the never-ending drama, and the joy of watching people in colorful latex onesies tumble (safely) down a staircase.  can someone explain why japanese game show 'slippery stairs' hasn't made its way to our part of the world yet pic.twitter.com/cd1BHvvoKl It’s unclear why the show hasn’t stormed the rest of the world. But if Twitter can make a movie starring Rihanna and Lupita Nyong’o a reality, it’s a safe bet that “Slippery Stairs” is coming to a small screen near you. There’s so much love for the show already: I am now the world's biggest Slippery Stairs fan, thank you @James_Dator https://t.co/hZTZliY6wG This Japanese game show (Slippery Stairs) deserves a TV Award for Best Drama. pic.twitter.com/uiFfb290PB Finally a game show that really is a perfect metaphor for life #SlipperyStairs https://t.co/5k1nQlyX4Q (via @elvis717) I haven’t stopped thinking about Slippery Stairs all day Oh, this is brilliant. Why can’t we have “Slippery Stairs” on @BBCOne ?  pic.twitter.com/WqCuuaH5fX I need to go to Japan for the Cherry Blossom Festival, Mario Kart, and Slippery stairs 😩😍😍👏
