It was not received well on Twitter, with many people pointing out that Prince Harry’s father, Prince Charles, divorced Princess Diana.

Rowling, also a divorcée, appeared to have the final say when she posted this single hashtag in support of the newly engaged couple: #TeamDivorcée https://t.co/p1sVmRsw9i Avada Kedavra!
