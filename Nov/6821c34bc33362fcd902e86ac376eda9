It's puppy love. A young girl gently recites lullabies to her family's newly adopted dog in an adorable video that's going viral. Lauren Malone, from Connecticut, shared the heartwarming clip of her daughter Katie tenderly cradling and singing to pooch Oakley to Facebook last week.  It ends with the totally relaxed pup letting out huge sighs of contentment. The footage had garnered more than 11.6 million views by Saturday morning. The family adopted the cute canine from the nonprofit American Lab Rescue group, which finds forever homes for Labradors and Labrador mixes. "And this is why you should adopt a rescue dog," Malone captioned the post. "Or two. Or three or four."
