Political expert Theo Venter has predicted three outcomes for the ANC after their national elective conference in December, each of which he says will have a different impact on the party, come the national elections in 2019. Speaking to HuffPost SA on Friday, Venter said the three outcomes are: a Cyril Ramaphosa victory, a unity candidate or compromise slate victory, or a win for Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma. "If Ramaphosa wins the election, then I think we can project it will be a huge challenge for the Democratic Alliance in 2019 to make the gains they think they can make. Their biggest threat is a Ramaphosa presidency, because [he] has the ability to get the ANC beyond 50 percent," Venter said.

Venter said that if Dlamini-Zuma wins, the ANC may lose power come 2019.  "That's the implication for the ANC, because the ANC is on a downward slope and needs to change tack. And unless they do it in a comprehensive way to convince the ordinary voter that change is coming, they are heading for trouble in 2019." The ANC's elective conference will take place from the 16th to the 20th December 2017 in Gauteng.
