For the last two decades South Africa's democratic centre has held together around our constitution. This pact rested upon the so-called "negotiated settlement", a ceasefire and arranged marriage of inconvenience between the apartheid regime and the African National Congress. The resultant wholesale transfer of political power, initiated by former president F.W. De Klerk upon the release of Nelson Mandela from prison, paved the way for a series of democratic firsts for the country. In 1994 the first democratic election where citizens of all races were given the franchise took place. From 1994 to 1999 sat the first democratic parliament where former president Nelson Mandela famously said of our "sick society": Meanwhile in 1999, the first peaceful transition of power from one head of state to another took place as former president Thabo Mbeki was elected the second democratic president of South Africa. But then, Jacob Zuma seized the party leadership and through a sleight of electoral hand, grabbed the presidency in 2009. Somewhere between 1999 and 2009 the democratic project in South Africa began to lose its way. The "foul means of apartheid", it would seem, have reasserted themselves. President Nelson Mandela, addressing the British parliament in 1999 described the four "founding stones" of the democratic order in South Africa, as that of; "national reconciliation", "a democratic system", ending the "enormous race and gender disparities in wealth, income and opportunity that we have inherited from our past and whose continued impact on our society necessarily subtracts from the achievement of our goals of national unity and reconciliation", and the "rebuilding and modernisation of our economy on a high, suitable growth path to end poverty, unemployment and backwardness".
