  Finally, at long last, we have another iconic Rihanna moment. Since the Grammys rarely get anything right, the singer's latest album "Anti" was criminally underrepresented at this year's ceremony. But RiRi took a page out of Beyonc√©'s book and turned lemons into lemonade. At the 59th annual Grammy Awards Sunday, Rihanna was spotted having the best time sipping out of a bejeweled flask all night long. Hey, you'd need some alcohol too if you were forced to sit through almost four hours of your competitors winning awards that belonged to you! Behold the glory that is peak Rihanna below.
