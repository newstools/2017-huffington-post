Nomuzi Mabena (known as Moozlie) dropped her new track Ride Or Die featuring Yung Swiss last night. The local queen of hip-hop, who has been praised for the role she has taken on in the industry released the track at midnight on her social media platforms. Described as a "fusion of R&B, hip-hop and dancehall", the track has Moozlie's characteristic not-to-be-messed-with swagger and the sound is reminiscent of a Caribbean feel that wouldn't be out of place on a Nicky Minaj album.  She released the song under her eponymous label, Nomuzi Mabena Music, which she started last year following her departure from Cash Time Life, the record label owned by Thabiso Khati. Her debut in 2015 on Kid X's track Se7en thrust Mabena -- who is also a television presenter -- into the spotlight on the hip-hop scene and she hit the ground running.

It seems she's right on track.
