February is the month of love all around the world, this we all know. Some feel excited about it, some depressed, others are just plain cynical. Stores and even schools cash in on it. And then there are some who spend their days trying to find love and the meaning of it. You'll find volumes of books and poetry dedicated to the concept of love or simply type in "how to find" and Google will pre-empt your question for you with the word love. I think the mistake we all make, is in thinking it's one-dimensional. In this year especially, I believe the meaning of love embraces many different notions all rolled into one and trying to apply it in one way or the other will change 2017 for the better, because This world needs more love in all its dimensions. It's a fast-moving, hectic and chaotic life we lead, leaving us little or no time for worrying about others and what they may need. Gosh, we hardly have time for what we ourselves need. All it takes though is a change in being, being happier, less self-involved and lighter in relations with others. Maybe just a little time each day will help slow us down, become more present in our thoughts and actions, a little less judgemental and a lot more loving. Love is the bridge between you and everything â€“ Rumi
