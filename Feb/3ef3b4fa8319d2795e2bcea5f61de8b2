Beyoncé surprised the world Wednesday when she announced that she's pregnant with twins. While most were elated, Coachella-goers were wondering what it means for the upcoming festival.  Last month, it was announced that Queen Bey would be headlining both Saturday shows, scheduled for April 15 and April 22, during the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, where general admission tickets go for a steep $400.
