*Sigh* when will people learn that Twitter Q&As are a bad idea? Today The Public Protector's office embarked on a "listening campaign" and part of it was a question and answer session on Twitter.  Public Protector advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane has had a shaky start to her term in office and even she admitted it in this tweet and added she'd been enjoying it.  It was just a matter of time though before people made the trending topic about everything other than Mkhwebane's actual job and this guy called it.  These are 17 of the most hilarious tweets from the hashtag.
