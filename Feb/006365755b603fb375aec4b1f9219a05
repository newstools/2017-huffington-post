Somewhere, Jacob Tremblay's ridiculously attractive parents are plotting his red carpet return to reclaim the distinguished honor of cutest child actor in the game. This year, his competition is Sunny Pawar, who blew audiences away in "Lion" as a younger version of actor Dev Patel's character. The 8-year-old star made his debut at the 89th Academy Awards on Sunday and the world proceeded to collectively "aww" as he ruled the red carpet. If you thought you were riding this Pawar train solo, we're here to assure you that Twitter also had absolutely zero chill during his red carpet arrival. Let's try and keep it together until the show starts, everyone, OK? chrissy teigen hugging sunny pawar awwww :') #oscars pic.twitter.com/AOvDGqAstS
