Somewhere, Jacob Tremblay's ridiculously attractive parents are plotting his red carpet return to reclaim the distinguished honor of cutest child actor in the game. This year, his competition is Sunny Pawar, who blew audiences away in "Lion" as a younger version of actor Dev Patel's character. The 8-year-old star made his debut at the 89th Academy Awards on Sunday and the world proceeded to collectively "aww" as he ruled the red carpet. If you thought you were riding this Pawar train solo, we're here to assure you that Twitter also had absolutely zero chill during his red carpet arrival. Let's try and keep it together until the show starts, everyone, OK? Sunny Pawar from @LionMovie completely steals the #Oscars red carpet with his adorable excitement. pic.twitter.com/dKfN3fsAHL Lion's Sunny Pawar is already an #Oscars pro Ô∏è pic.twitter.com/7BziQtiuO5 Prepare to lose it cause LION's Sunny Pawar is here #Oscars pic.twitter.com/z382D7lq9T Jacob Tremblay is so shook #Oscars pic.twitter.com/n5wIk4Kuyn I just made a series of high-pitched squeals at the INCREDIBLY ADORABLE Sunny Pawar (of LION) and his little tuxedo and cute kicks - J sunny pawar: gudu
