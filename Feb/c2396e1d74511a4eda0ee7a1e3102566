Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema claims to have inside knowledge on how the African National Congress Women's League (ANCWL) made a U-turn on its preferred female presidential candidate. Malema gave his take on why the party decided to dump Baleka Mbete — who is also the Speaker of Parliament who tried to shut Malema up — in favour of Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma. At stake is the presidency of the ANC, in a party election coming up later this year, but the bigger prize is the presidency of the country in 2019, which the party president is in pole position to take. Speaking in Johannesburg on Tuesday, Malema claimed the league had been bought and claimed that Mbete was sold a dream. He said he was trying to make sense of what happened. This is his take on the matter. Malema said Mbete is now looking for a different ticket to get to the helm of the organisation, and claimed she is now trying to work with Mpumalanga chairperson David Mabuza to get to Luthuli House, the ANC headquarters. "She is now talking to David Mabuza so that she can be president in DD's campaign and he will be the deputy. DD's campaign has lots of money, you must not undermine it. It has potential to emerge. They are backed by people who don't play," he said.
