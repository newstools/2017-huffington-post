We've all been there. It seems someone treated the talk station's Twitter account as their own personal profile. The station has said it was hacked.   The epic fail tweet specifically mentioned Masechaba Ndlovu and Lawrence Tlhabane. Ndlovu currently hosts Power FM's POWER Life, a popular lifestyle show that deals with everything from sex to spirituality. Lawrence Tlhabane took over the breakfast show from heavyweight Tim Modise as POWER Breakfast co-host last year. Power FM apologised to audiences. ANNOUNCEMENT: Our Twitter handle was hacked an hour ago. We speedily recovered it. We apologize for the unfortunate interruption Ouchie. Don't worry Power FM, it's happened to the best of us.
