The Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue and its three covers debuted on Wednesday, but we're most excited about one particular lady inside the mag: the one and only Serena Williams. The recently engaged tennis champion looks sexy, strong and fierce as ever in the spread, wearing a teeny-tiny high-cut white Swim Like A Mermaid one-piece with wind-swept hair. Williams share another image on Instagram, in which she wears yet another small one-piece ― this one by American Apparel ― that matches the crystal blue waters behind her. #SISwim on sale now @si_swimsuit A post shared by Serena Williams (@serenawilliams) on Feb 15, 2017 at 6:30am PST Williams is no stranger to the pages of Sports Illustrated, earning its Sportsperson of the Year title in 2015. But there is something new happening: Williams revealed in a behind-the-scenes video that the shoot marked her first time ever wearing a thong bikini. "I'm officially a thong girl now," she said. It makes sense that Williams is once again featured in the swimsuit issue, which includes many different inspiring women, including her fellow tennis stars Caroline Wozniacki and Genie Bouchard, fellow uber-athlete Simone Biles, and model Ashley Graham. Head to Sports Illustrated to see a slew of gorgeous images of Williams.
