UPDATE: Halima Aden has officially arrived. The 19-year-old model and Muslim refugee made her New York Fashion Week debut and walked Kanye West’s Yeezy Season 5 fashion show on Wednesday, wearing a black hijab with a golden fur coat and black pointed boots. IMG Models, who now represents Aden, tweeted a video of the model strutting down the catwalk and one thing’s for sure: the Somali-American is a natural on the runway. Previously: Halima Aden already broke barriers by being the first Miss Minnesota contestant to compete in a hijab and burkini, but she’s only just begun. The 19-year-old just signed a modeling contract with IMG Models, according to Business of Fashion. @araweelostudio A post shared by Halima Aden (@kinglimaa) on Dec 5, 2016 at 1:55pm PST Aden, a Somali-American born in a Kenyan refugee camp, will debut on the runway on Wednesday night at the Yeezy Season 5 show and is slated to appear in the March issue of CR Fashion Book.
