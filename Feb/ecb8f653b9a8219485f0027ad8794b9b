Will anyone take him seriously? Brian Molefe had his first day at work in his new job on Thursday, as a member of Parliament (MP) for the African National Congress (ANC). When Speaker Baleka Mbete announced him, the heckling started, with a shout of "Where is that corrupt bastard?" from Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) MP Moses Mbatha, reported News24. Newly sworn in ANC MP #BrianMolefe is welcomed to National Assembly by being called a "corrupt bastard" by an opposition MP.  And the speculation about his expected career path continued. Minister of Energy? Minister of Finance? My reliable sources tell me that Brian Molefe will be the next Energy Minster.There is no need to guess why. Keep this tweet for future ref.   #BrianMolefe the brilliance of @zapiro yet again! pic.twitter.com/VdseTc2ZvL  Or Minister of the Saxonwold Shebeen? Baleka: "Do you promise to uphold the Constitution of Saxonwold Shebeen?"#BrianMolefe: "I do. So help me Gupta"
Baleka: "Shots for all!" pic.twitter.com/wt25Zn2xMe  Molefe's last job was Eskom CEO, a job he left in disgrace after former public protector Thuli Madonsela's "State of Capture" report linked him to the President Jacob Zuma's controversial friends the Guptas. This is where the "Saxonwold Shebeen" emerged: Molefe claimed tearfully at an Eskom briefing in November that he hadn't been visiting the Guptas at their Saxonwold mansion, but commented that there was a shebeen in the area, which nobody has been able to find. He resigned from Eskom soon afterwards, but seems to miss the job as he still retweets Eskom's tweets. His accession to Parliament was a little wobbly, because the ANC branch in the North West which supposedly nominated him for a hastily vacated seat flatly denied him, then another structure for apparently the same branch backed him. A membership form was flourished in public, and immediately lampooned. ThingsToDoToday #2: Remind my branch @StateShebeen 2 organize presser 2 claim #BrianMolefe s our own. @GwedeUncle @JJTabane @AtulGuptaSahara pic.twitter.com/HctmK8WRnt   His swearing in was announced, retracted, then done quietly in an office. Whenever we want. https://t.co/M0SMfCNsDM  In Parliament, the opposition Democratic Alliance were thrilled. Unprecedented hostile reception in Parliament for the Gupta Ambassador and now MP Brian Molefe. What a complete gift for opposition!  Outside Parliament there was plenty of cynicism.
