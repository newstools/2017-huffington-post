Valentine's Day might be for lovers, but who says you need a partner to celebrate?

February 13 marks Galentine's Day â€“ a day to show the ladies in your life some much deserved appreciation. The special day originated in 2010 when Amy Poehler's "Parks and Recreaction" character, Leslie Knope, introduced the concept to the world for the very first time.




                            



    


"Oh it's only the best day of the year," Knope declared. "Every February 13th, my lady friends and I leave our husbands and our boyfriends at home, and we just come and kick it, breakfast-style. Ladies celebrating ladies. It's like Lilith Fair, minus the angst. Plus frittatas."

Since then, many women have adopted Feb. 13 to celebrate with their crews. But in case you need more than just the promise of brunch to start your own Galentine's tradition, here are five reasons Valentine's Day is better with your girlfriends.

1. Galentine's Day helps you focus on the positive. 

Valentine's Day is often thought of as the loneliest day of the year for singles. After all, every February we're bombarded with store shelves lined with pink and red hearts, gushy advertisements on our TVs and, worst of all, selfies of excessively happy couples all over social media.

But instead of isolating yourself into a pit of despair, Galentine's Day is a chance to refocus your energy and celebrate the love of family and friends. After all, these are the people in your life who will stick around even when relationships end, so why not show them some love?

2. You can celebrate whether you're single or attached. A photo posted by Amanda Rose (@hearteyesshoppe) on Feb 1, 2017 at 3:01pm PST A photo posted by viaONEHOPE (@viaonehope) on Feb 1, 2017 at 12:13pm PST
