Forget the sands of time. At age 63, Christie Brinkley can still make a splash at the beach. The model returned to the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue in a photo shoot with her daughters, Alexa Ray Joel, 31, and Sailor Brinkley Cook, 18. In a shot released Monday, the three pose together in black bathing suits. @christiebrinkley is back in a bikini for #SISwim 2017 (and she's brought two very special guests!). A photo posted by Sports Illustrated Swimsuit (@si_swimsuit) on Feb 6, 2017 at 5:51pm PST Brinkley graced the Swimsuit Issue cover in 1979, 1980 and 1981 and has appeared in the magazine eight times overall â€• the last time coming in 2004. When Sports Illustrated approached her about another go-round, Brinkley balked. "My first thought was, 'At my age? No way!'" she told People. "When I turned 30, I was like, 'This is the last time I'm posing in a bathing suit!' When this issue comes out, I'll be 63. I thought, 'Those days are over.' But to get to do it with my girls, I thought, 'One last go!'" Brinkley said a comeback in the iconic issue stirred up old feelings. "I can get very emotional about this," she told Sports Illustrated. "How many years ago, I was that insecure girl hoping that I would be good enough for the magazine. So to see my daughters now having the same thoughts I had, and to be able to see them actually be there on the job, was definitely a big moment."
