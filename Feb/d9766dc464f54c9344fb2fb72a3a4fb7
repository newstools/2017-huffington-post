Blac Chyna has never been afraid to show some skin, and the reality star said she took it all off for a recent photoshoot to celebrate her heritage. Chyna shared three photographs on her Instagram on Thursday, all taken by photographer Orin Fleurimont. Each photo shows her wearing white body paint and is respectively captioned with a single word: "Queen. History. Bold." "In celebration of Black History Month, I wanted to push out my inner Queen, express my ethnicity and beauty unapologetically!" Chyna told People magazine.
