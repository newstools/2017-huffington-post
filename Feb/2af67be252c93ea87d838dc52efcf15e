Everyone will process Beyoncé losing Album of the Year to Adele at the Grammys in their own way, but at least we have a new song to help us cope with this award show foolery. Immediately following the ceremony, DJ Khaled dropped a new track off his forthcoming album "Grateful" featuring Queen B and Jay Z titled "Shining." The song is the first official collaboration for the couple since "Drunk in Love" and "Tom Ford" were released in 2013. Remember, the rapper was famously seen and not heard on Beyoncé's 2016 album, "Lemonade." #DJKHALED "SHINING" FT. @beyonce & JAY Z!!
