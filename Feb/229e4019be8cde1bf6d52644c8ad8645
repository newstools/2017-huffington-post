The 2017 Oscars red carpet wasn't complete until Chrissy Teigen and John Legend showed up. Teigen sparkled in a gorgeous Zuhair Murad gown with intricate beading and a belted midsection. She paired her look with dazzling earrings, an elegant updo and one of her trademark thigh-high splits, of course. Legend said his wife looked "like a goddess" during their interview with Ryan Seacrest and we couldn't agree more: John Legend schooling all SOs by telling Chrissy Teigen "You look like a goddess" on national television pic.twitter.com/nR8R2BWmni The singer, who Teigen pointed out was a bit nervous about his upcoming piano medley at the show, looked as classy as ever in a black tux. We can't get enough of these two!
