We're well into the swing of the annual international award show season and our local stars are set to shine just as brightly here at home. The 2017 Metro FM Music Awards is coming up in Durban on 25 February 2017 and the announcement of the nominees of the 2017 South African Film and Television Awards (SAFTAs) was made this morning. At a breakfast on Thursday in Bryanston, Johannesburg, the National Film and Video Foundation (NFVF) made the announcement of the 258 nominees in 89 categories. With the theme "SA has got it, let's celebrate it" event host, actress Nambitha Mpumlwana, named the 2017 SAFTAs nominees from over 400 production companies.  South African stage, film and television legend Dr John Kani is one of the judges on the 2017 SAFTAs judging panel and spoke at today's panel discussion at the event.   The ceremony will be held in Sun City from 16 to 18 March 2017 and nominees include Anele Mdoda and Bonnie Mbuli for Best Talk Show Host and Dan Jaques Mouton for his film "Noem My Skollie". We hope to see a red carpet full of local design -- SA's got it and we should definitely be celebrating it!
