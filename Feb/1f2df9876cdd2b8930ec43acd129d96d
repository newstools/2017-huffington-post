When model and entrepreneur Mala Bryan first launched her range of black and brown dolls in 2016, she had no idea just how badly they were needed. Now, as she continues to create dolls for children from all backgrounds with all skin colours and hair types, she has expanded her collection with the announcement of Alexa -- the first doll with albinism to join the Malaville world. We have another explorer in Malaville! Alexa loves caves, and her dream is to visit as many as possible around the world. #albinodoll #AlexaDoll #albinodoll #fashiondoll #blackdolls #blackdoll #blackgirlmagic #blackdollsmatter #dollcollectors #dollsofinstagram #dollstagram #blackhair #dollcollector #dollstagram #afrohair #curlyhair #dollphotography ‚úîDolls are available for purchase in link in bio ‚úî **Please note that dolls on the site are the only ones available for purchase.

Super proud if this lovely lady right here. I wanted her to be perfect so she took a lot longer than I expected, but I'm now ready to introduce her to the world! Meet Alexa! She's an artist and really gets into her painting, can you tell? :-) Alexa is our first albino doll and she's super proud of it. Very confident and comfortable in her own skin, she will soon be a force to reckon with in the art world. We will be seeing lots more of her around but please help me in welcoming her to Malaville!

In it, fashion stylist Maisha, fashion designer Mala, model Malina, and interior designer Mhina welcome black and brown children to play with dolls that look like them. Happy Boxing Day!

We have been away for a while but with good reason!! Needed to focus on new line!! They've been ready since a couple of months but I needed to have some alone time with them, making sure they are perfect for you guys! Still have one more to name but for now we have Viv, Lola, Alexa and my first adult collector will be the goddess Oshun (yellow) will post some close ups soon. Fingers crossed that they will be on shelves in April! #didyouspotthealbino #albinodoll #redheaddoll #redhead #albino #curlyhair #afrohair #blackdolls #Repost @mc2modelsmiami with „Éª„Éª„Éª Gorgeous Mala @malabryan stopped in to say hello and show us the latest editions to her own doll collection called Malaville @malavilledolls #model #designer #entrapanuer #malavilledolls #mc2modelsmiami A post shared by Malaville Toys (@malavilledolls) on Feb 17, 2017 at 11:41am PST
