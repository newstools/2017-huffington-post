As of mid-day Tuesday, Feb. 7, Jamie Lynn Spears' 8-year-old daughter Maddie Aldridge, who had been in critical condition after an ATV accident, is now reportedly awake. People learned the news through a statement from the hospital where Aldridge is being treated, provided to the outlet by a Spears family rep. The statement begins, "with her father, mother and stepfather by her side, Maddie regained consciousness." It continues: The 8-year-old daughter of entertainer Jamie Lynn Spears was involved in an ATV accident at a family home Sunday in Kentwood, La. Paramedics resuscitated her and she was airlifted to a local hospital. She is aware of her surroundings and recognizes those family members who have kept a round-the-clock vigil since the accident. Aldridge is said to be "awake and talking," and doctors even removed her ventilator, though she "continues to receive oxygen" and is being monitored closely. The statement also reads, "She has not suffered any neurological consequences from the accident." It's amazing news for the Spears family. Though early reports said that Aldridge was injured on a hunting excursion, more recent reports claim that the young girl was riding an ATV within view of Spears and her stepfather when she overcorrected a turn and crashed into a pond, becoming submerged. Following the accident, Jamie Lynn Spears' former "Zoey 101" castmates sent their love and well wishes, and her sister Britney posted a message asking for prayers. Well, keep those prayers coming. It looks like they may be working after all. Million Reasons- Lady Gaga A video posted by Jamie Lynn Spears (@jamielynnspears) on Oct 7, 2016 at 3:31pm PDT
