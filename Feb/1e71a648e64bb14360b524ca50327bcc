On Saturday, author J.K. Rowling tweeted out how delighted she was to watch British TV personality Piers Morgan “being told to fuck off” by comedian Jim Jefferies on the latest “Real Time with Bill Maher.” Growing tired of Morgan defending President Donald Trump’s travel ban during the show’s panel debate, Jefferies finally told Morgan to “fuck off.” Then repeated it multiple times. Much to Rowling’s delight. The author enjoyed it so thoroughly, she piled on via her Twitter account. Yes, watching Piers Morgan being told to fuck off on live TV is *exactly* as satisfying as I'd always imagined. https://t.co/4FII8sYmIt Morgan didn’t take too kindly to being targeted, and returned fire. This is why I've never read a single word of Harry Potter. https://t.co/XUJBMs4KKm Never one to back down when it comes to attacks on her beloved Harry Potter book series, Rowling responded. .@piersmorgan If only you'd read Harry Potter, you'd know the downside of sucking up to the biggest bully in school is getting burned alive. Morgan was now badly beaten and hanging on the ropes, barely a leg to stand on in this fight. But Rowling wasn’t going to let him catch his breath. She wound up for her finishing move, the “Avada Ka-daaaaaamn.” #StillHurts pic.twitter.com/28rUHy2McC Beating level: savage. Rest in peace, Piers Morgan’s Twitter account. It was just 6 years old.
