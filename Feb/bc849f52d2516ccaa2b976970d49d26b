Asians were definitely not well-represented at the Oscars, with Dev Patel being the sole Asian nominee in an acting category. But that doesnâ€™t mean they were silent during Sundayâ€™s Academy Awards ceremony. In a night that saw Jackie ChanÂ recognized as a Lifetime Achievement Award honoree, andÂ Warren BeattyÂ read out the wrong Best Picture winner,Â Asian Twitter got lit. Check out some of its realest tweets about the Oscars below. Warren Beatty just pulled a Steve Harvey, and I could not be happier. #Oscars pause. The #Oscars put Jackie Chan in the balcony? JACKIE CHAN IN THE NOSE BLEED SEATS?!?!?! D.I.S.R.E.S.P.E.C.T.F.U.L.
