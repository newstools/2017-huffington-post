Trans models may slowly be more and more commonplace on catwalks and magazines in the UK and USA, but for many places around the world this is not the case. Now a 32-year-old Nepalese model, Ajali Lama, has been chosen out of hundreds of women to walk in Mumbai's Lakm√© Fashion Week, the first trans person ever to have ever done so. Now here are five things you need to know about this rising star. #womenspecial #festival #teej A photo posted by Anjali Lama (@anjali_lama_official) on Sep 4, 2016 at 8:27am PDT Given the name Navin Waiba at birth, Lama grew up as part of a family of nine, in a rural farming village in Nepal, Nuwakot. She decided to move to the capital, Kathmandu after graduating from high school. A photo posted by Anjali Lama (@anjali_lama_official) on Aug 19, 2015 at 9:16am PDT Lama told The Washington Post that she began her transition after watching a Nepalese television show called 'Struggle'. She said: "That day I understood that I am also that kind of person." But her transition wasn't easy, Lama says she was teased by colleagues and customers at the hotel where she worked: "Mentally I was tortured." She has also revealed that her brothers and father have not supported her transition: "He'll never see me as a daughter," she said.

She told The Washington Post that she saw a group of transgender women heading to a club. Approaching them she asked for advice. They gave her the phone number for a community office for LGBT affairs. Two days later, she visited the organisation, and later became a member of staff in 2006. The first transgender model to walk an Indian fashion runway.
