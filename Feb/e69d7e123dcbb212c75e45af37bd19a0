So much for wanting to share some personal news. Pop star Demi Lovato was hit by a firestorm of haters on Twitter after sharing the results of a DNA ancestry test on Friday. Lovato, 24, revealed that she's mostly Spanish, with Native American, Scandinavian, Irish and British roots. She also said she's 1 percent African. I did a DNA test and found out I'm mainly Spanish, with Native American, SCANDINAVIAN (which I had NO idea), Irish, BRITISH.... And I'm 1% African!!!! Lovato's clear excitement was perhaps expected, since she's been outspoken about her love of Africa. After celebrating her 21st birthday by volunteering with a children's charity in Kenya, she got a tattoo of the continent on her arm. "I went to Kenya and it was just a very, very inspirational journey that I feel like really had a huge impact on my life," she told iHeart radio while discussing her ink. "I would've gotten Kenya but then people would have been like, 'What's that?' So Africa's a little more distinct." Her test results were not well received. @ddlovato pic.twitter.com/o7fUCvw9dC @Flawless_Demi_ @ddlovato everybody is at least 1% African but you don't see everyone running around with tattoos of Africa @ddlovato pic.twitter.com/e30HiLoPtE @ddlovato pic.twitter.com/LJTqv7ux3K .@greylovxto @upallnightpayno @ddlovato If anyone has trouble understanding this it's from mean girls pic.twitter.com/wXFfbwft2Z @ddlovato pic.twitter.com/AoowvBFdL4 The "Confident" singer's mood went from excited to downcast in a matter of minutes. In a follow-up Tweet, she called out some of her haters for being "mean [as f**k]." Just thought it was cool and totally random. Some of y'all are mean af. Twitter sucks. Fortunately, there were plenty of others who embraced her Lovato's news. @ddlovato Gurl don't let it bother you. You did nothing wrong. Knowing your ancestry is an amazing thing. Be proud of it. @ddlovato I thought it was cool, I've always wondered about mine tbh. Love you Demi ️ @ddlovato everyone's got a little bit of African in them. No matter where we come from. #biology #evolution @ddlovato People are mean, but don't let that get you down. Thanks for sharing your information. It was interesting to read. @ddlovato ignore the haters girl! We love you and appreciate you sharing that sending you all our love️️ @ddlovato I did a DNA test too, and I found I'm 1% African and 99% in love with Queen Demi lol A 2014 study found that roughly 6 million Americans who identified themselves as white were found to have some African ancestry. That equated to roughly 3.5 percent of self-described white Americans having 1 percent or more African ancestry, according to The Washington Post. To reach that 1 percent, the individuals would have to have an African relative no further back than seven generations, the paper reported.
