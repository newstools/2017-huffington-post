One might think fame and fortune would insulate celebrities from properly freaking out about Beyoncé's surprise pregnancy announcement on Wednesday, but there's nothing like Queen Bey to humanize even the most untouchable of A-listers. Everyone from Brie Larson and Rihanna to Beyoncé's mom, Tina Knowles, and Ellen DeGeneres chimed in on social media about the newest additions to the Carter-Knowles family. Even former Bey feuder Piers Morgan had something nice to say! Check out some of the reactions from the likes of Zara Larsson, Laverne Cox, Issa Rae and more below: so excited about this news!!!! Congratulations to you @beyonce and my big bro Jay!!!!
