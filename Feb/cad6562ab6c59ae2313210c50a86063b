  Taylor Swift performed her first show of 2017 on Saturday night, and unfortunately for Swifties, it might be her last. During her pre-Super-Bowl show for DIRECTV in Houston, the pop star revealed she has no plans to perform for the rest of the year. "As far as I know I'm only doing one show in 2017, and as far as I know, this is that show," she told the crowd, before giving the announcement a positive spin. "So what I'm trying to tell you is, by coming here tonight, you're essentially attending 100 percent of my tour dates for the year, so thank you!" Swift made sure to give the crowd, which included an extremely enthusiastic Lea Michele, what they came for, though. The pop star played hits like "You Belong With Me," "Shake It Off" and "Love Story." She also performed her newest track, "I Don't Wanna Live Forever" (sans Zayn), and "Better Man," the song she wrote for Little Big Town. It was the first time Swift performed both tracks live. If you recall, Swift also performed only one live concert in 2016 ― at the Grand Prix ― which just so happened to be in Texas as well. Surely this just means the "22" singer is spending more time working on new music, right? We, and the Swifties of the world, can dream.
