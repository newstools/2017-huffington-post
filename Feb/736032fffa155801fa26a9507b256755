Heat the oil in a frying pan. Add the garlic and stir-fry for 30 seconds. 2. Add the morogo and stir-fry until wilted. 3. Remove from the heat and season with freshly ground black pepper. Add the feta and stir together. 4. Fill the cavities of the butternuts with the morogo mixture. Cover with slices of red onion. Drizzle with olive oil. 5. Place each butternut half onto a double layer of aluminium foil. Fold the foil closed and make sure it is completely sealed. Cook on the braai on the edge of the coals.
