Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's first face-to-face meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump was off to a great start Monday, if their handshakes were any indication.

Trump greeted Trudeau at the door to the White House's West Wing, where the two had their first already-extremely-analyzed joining of the hands: Trump tried to pull his standard pull 'em in handshake and Trudeau literally pushed him back to stop him. I'm dying. https://t.co/65iZvojmbM Promising start: That Trudeau-Trump handshake look normal, not one of those crazy yanking things Trump does. Trudeau resisting Trump's weird handshake is the biggest display of dominance in the history of Canada [Trump and Abe hold hands for 19 seconds]
