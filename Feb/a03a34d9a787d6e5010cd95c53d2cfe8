The 2017 OscarsÂ red carpet was star-studded, sparkly and as always, dripping in high fashion. While we would have been perfectly happy to give Taraji P. Henson all of the top spots for best-dressed on the red carpet, there were plenty other equally beautiful looks to swoon over. Janelle Monae took a risk in Elie Saab that paid off tenfold, while Jessica Biel stunned in a golden, Oscar statuesque KaufmanFranco. Take a look at the rest of our picks for best-dressed below (in no particular order). And make sure to scroll all the way to the bottom to see ALL the looks from the night. Share this slide:
