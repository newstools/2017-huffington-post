When it comes to playing by your own rules, no one does it quite like Rihanna. During her time in the spotlight, we've watched her transform from the young woman behind pop bangers like 'Pon De Replay' and 'Don't Stop The Music' to one of the biggest stars in the world - and when we say she dances to the beat of her own drum, we mean it. From her social media putdowns to her amazing red carpet looks, we're celebrating her 29th birthday with 29 of the moments she gave zero fucks, and we loved her all the more for it... The celebrity shade that we'll never tire of. Ouch. "Just give me my award, Aubrey..." Who else could steal the show at the Grammys without even leaving her seat? I'm a 23 year old rockstar with NO KIDS! What's up with everybody wantin me to be a parent? I'm just a girl, I can only be your/our voice! Her controversial 'Man Down' video may have ruffled feathers, but she didn't care. Kendall Jenner was 16 . She's a woman with her priorities in order. This Met Gala look was iconic. Honestly, who else on earth could pull this dress off like Rih? You know, the ones that eventually got her banned from Instagram? Straddling a cannon in a Mickey Mouse helmet? All in a day's work for Rihanna... We blush just thinking about it. Rihanna. On board a plane. With a load of journalists. Travelling to seven cities in seven days. What could go wrong, eh? Much like the time her 'X Factor' performance of 'Only Girl (In The World)' descended into a food fight. She's a complete star, basically. Yep, even on daytime. When Charlie Sheen accused her of being rude to him in a restaurant, this is how she responded. Incredible. But seriously, don't mess. And it's a gesture she does a lot. "Come on... we're gonna have sex... toodle-oo!" Goals. @MTV Yikes.... @rihanna ran out of fucks to give Never change.
