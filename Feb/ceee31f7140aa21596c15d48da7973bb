It’s been two and a half years since “hot convict” Jeremy Meeks first looked straight into our souls with those piercing blue eyes, and one year since he was released from a California prison to begin pursuing his destiny: modeling. Now, he’s ― where else? ― at New York Fashion Week. Meeks walked the runway at the Phillip Plein show Monday, looking as handsome as he did in his famous mugshot. The 33-year-old, who served time for a felony weapons conviction, previously told ABC News he never “thought that everyone in the world would recognize me for my looks.” He signed with a management agency in 2016, and then shared many a shirtless photo on Instagram. Now, though, he’s rubbing elbows with former French Vogue editor Carine Roitfeld and opening one of the most hotly anticipated runway shows of the week. This is the real deal, people. Both attendees and far-off onlookers were quick to share the news on social media. Felons tho 🖤 A post shared by Dena Silver (@deenersilver) on Feb 14, 2017 at 3:48am PST We have a feeling this is far from the last we’ll see of Meeks, and we’re not complaining.
