South Africa's drought is not yet officially over but heavy rains have left water pouring into the dams. Johannesburg Water and Gauteng Weather said the Vaal Dam was more than 97% full. South Africa, particularly Gauteng, is heavily reliant on the Katse Dam in the Lesotho Highlands Water Project, which provides water for the Vaal Dam. The latest data from the Department of Water Affairs and Sanitation on the Katse Dam was a week ago, when it reported that it was still less than half full.
