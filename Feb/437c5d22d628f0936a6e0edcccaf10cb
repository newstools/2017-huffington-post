Rapper Riky Rick hit out at the music industry at the Metro FM Music Awards on Saturday and South Africans love it. According to The Times, he said that 90% of music on the radio was "trash" and said artists should publish their music online instead. But his tirade was interrupted when his microphone was cut, the paper reported. Later, in an interview backstage with Khanyi Mbau and Somizi Mhlongo, Riky Rick reportedly said "powers must stop playing with the people... they are not stupid". Mabala Noise, the label he is signed with, had high praise for the rapper's rant. According to The Times, the label said: "World class acceptance speech by Riky Rick â€“ message to unheard artists. When radio and TV ignore you, your success can be found on the internet."
