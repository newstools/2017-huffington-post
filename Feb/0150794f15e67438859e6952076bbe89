 Travis Scott definitely wasn't lip-synching when he took the stage with Drake Wednesday night. The hip-hop artist fell into a hole during a performance of "Goosebumps" at London's O2 arena during a stop on Drake and Young Thug's Boy Meets World tour. Video captured an autotuned yelp as Scott disappeared. Scott, who was appearing as a special guest, was MIA for just a few seconds. With some help from Drake, he climbed back out and kept the show going. The same couldn't be said for a giant globe that was designed to inflate during the show, however.

"London, England, I love you, I hope you enjoyed your free show," he told fans at the end of the night, the BBC reported. Fans weren't shy in expressing their thanks. Drake said he'll refund everybody's ticket back just because of ONE technical problem. He is God sent.
