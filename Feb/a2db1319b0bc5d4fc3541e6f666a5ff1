Another day, another false alarm from the president — and then a welcome stretch of comic relief on Twitter. Donald Trump's incredulousness at a rally Saturday that something had happened the previous night in Sweden as he was referring to European terrorist attacks had everyone scratching their heads. "You look at what's happening in Germany, you look at what's happening last night in Sweden," he said passionately but mysteriously. "Sweden! Who would believe this?" No one could believe it — not even Sweden, whose officials contacted the White House to find out what he was talking about. Former Swedish prime minister Carl Bildt asked what Trump had been smoking. Sweden? Terror attack? What has he been smoking? Questions abound. https://t.co/XWgw8Fz7tj Which led to this: Trump clarified Sunday that he was referring to something he had seen on Fox News, apparently an interview with conservative filmmaker Ami Horowitz who linked a purported rising crime rate to thousands of refugees Sweden has welcomed to its country. The nation took in more refugees per capita than any other country in Europe in 2015. It was all great fuel for the Twitter fire that erupted with snarky rejoinders at #LastNightinSweden, #PrayForSweden, #SwedishIncident and #IStandWithSweden. Critics especially enjoyed juxtaposing Trump's implied terror attack against the reality of a pretty, tranquil, sometimes even downright dull Sweden. #lastnightinsweden : Mass immigration from the north, due to global warming. pic.twitter.com/fJ8nMLKREP Never Forget! #IStandWithSweden #swedishincident pic.twitter.com/VDjCUkVoxS live shot from #lastnightinsweden! #Trump #SwedenLastNight #bjoernout pic.twitter.com/KizV23NcUT #LastNightInSweden some dudes killed like 20 beers.

Alternative facts #swedenincident pic.twitter.com/QbSAzsHmyo Last night, Trump's hair color appeared in the Northern Lights. #LastNightInSweden J.K. Rowling got in on the fun after Swedish news reported that the big story in the country on "terror day" was the rescue from a well of a horse named Biscuit. "Make Biscuit dry!" Rowling rallied with a new hashtag. #MakeBiscuitDryAgain https://t.co/C7rPpZrcNf Thanks to your prayers @jk_rowling Biscuit soon dry again #MakeBiscuitDryAgain @ChelseaClinton pic.twitter.com/shs4SnlM7P There were the inevitable quips (including one from Chesea Clinton referring to Trump aide KellyAnne Conway's mention earlier this month of the nonexistent "Bowling Green Massacre" and White House spokesman Sean Spicer's reference to a nonexistent terror attack in Atlanta. The man the president spoke so glowingly of earlier this month, the late Frederick Douglass, appeared to resurrect again vowing to save Sweden. What happened in Sweden Friday night? Did they catch the Bowling Green Massacre perpetrators? For all those involved in the incident #LastNightInSweden the thoughts & prayers of the Bowling Green Massacre Survivors Group are with you. I believe our @potus @realdonaldtrump was referring to the @IKEAUSA massacre of Kullen, the Hurdal, the Hemnes and Trysil. #IStandWithSweden pic.twitter.com/lhqki1cvqb Sweden terror incident is the largest attack that never happened in Swedish history. This travesty will never be remembered. #SwedenIncident Frederick Douglass tasked w/ investigating Sweden Massacre #LastNightInSweden #IStandWithSweden pic.twitter.com/nzAk9ieMdY There had to be some comments about Ikea of course. After the terrible events #lastnightinSweden , IKEA have sold out of this: pic.twitter.com/Bs1XI7ffKG And, inevitably, Stockholm syndrome raised its frightening head.  The more Swedes hear about Trump the more they dislike him. It's like reverse Stockholm syndrome. #lastnightinsweden America, if you start to identify with your captor-President, please call.
