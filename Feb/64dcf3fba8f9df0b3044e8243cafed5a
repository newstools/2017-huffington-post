South Africans are reeling following the shock news by the health ombudsman that 94 psychiatric patients, and counting, have died during the chaotic move from Life Esidimeni hospital by the Gauteng Health department â€” against repeated advice, legal action and entreaties from experts, activists and the families of the patients. This is the full report on the matter by the Health Ombud Professor Malegapuru William Makgoba. NGO Section27 was one of the organisations involved in trying to stop the department through legal action. They have released the following fact sheet to help explain the events leading up to the tragedy. What happened? What were the legal consequences of the move? Did anyone try to stop the move? Families, civil society organisations and professional associations all tried desperately to convince the Department it was placing patients in danger by moving them to places that could not give them the care they required. They were even forced to take the Department to court twice. How could they have known it would go so wrong? The national and provincial health departments' own policies predicted this outcome. In addition, experts and families uniformly and repeatedly warned of the consequences. Finally, the Department was told what would happen in the course of two rounds of litigation What should happen now? Credit: Section27
