For HuffPost’s #LoveTakesAction series, we’re telling stories of how people are standing up to hate and supporting those most threatened. What will you stand up for? Tell us with #LoveTakesAction. Love has the power to create bonds, forge community, ignite a spark that galvanizes people into action. Writers, activists and thought leaders have long used words to light that spark. Through prose and speeches and essays, history and her chronologers have taught us that love is a force to be reckoned with.
