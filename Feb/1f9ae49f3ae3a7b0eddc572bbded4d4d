This week in cultural appropriation, actress Alyssa Milano decided to rock cornrows with extensions. The "Charmed" actress showed off her new hairstyle in an Instagram photo on Saturday while in Houston for the Super Bowl. Yay! Had a great time at the OFF THE FIELD PLAYERS WIVES ASSOCIATION fashion show today. #SB51 #teamtouch A photo posted by Alyssa Milano (@milano_alyssa) on Feb 3, 2017 at 1:24pm PST White celebrities wearing this traditionally black hairstyle, though tired, isn't new (see: the entire Kardashian-Jenner clan). But the reaction to Milano's braids is priceless. Just look at the faces of the people in the background of Milano's photo, as noted by The Huffington Post's Philip Lewis: Some social media users also commented under her Instagram photo. One person said, "Girl, who did these braids?" Another commenter said, "The people in the background are feeling the same as me." One Twitter user posted a photo of the back of Milano's hair, posted by her stylist, and pointed out why Milano may have gotten such confused looks. Other folks on Twitter chimed in with their two cents, too. @Phil_Lewis_ @_zolarmoon Wait pic.twitter.com/OTEB2VtIay @Phil_Lewis_ @HITOKIRl The amount of disgust on their faces is unmatched by anything I've seen in all of my existence @Phil_Lewis_ lmao i woulda been looking at her the same way pic.twitter.com/7OiU3Uv9sp Milano briefly addressed the braids after Twitter user @rosandyreel told her that "black cultural styles are not costumes." Welp.
