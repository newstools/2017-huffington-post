Past midnight on Sunday evening, Warren Beatty announced "La La Land" as Best Picture at the 89th annual Academy Awards. The thing was, "La La Land" didn't win — "Moonlight" did. Midway through their acceptance speech, the producers of the Damien Chazelle–directed flick stopped to announce that there had been a mistake. Host Jimmy Kimmel and presenter Beatty came out to reveal that "Moonlight" was the actual winner. Beatty was accidentally given the Best Actress envelope, which was handed out right before to Emma Stone for her role in "La La Land." He saw the movie title and passed the envelope to co-presenter Faye Dunaway, who announced "La La Land" as the winner. Although it is officially the most awkward ― and biggest ― moment in Oscars history, the producers of "La La Land" gracefully handed their statues to the "Moonlight" team as the audience stared in utter confusion-slash-amazement.
