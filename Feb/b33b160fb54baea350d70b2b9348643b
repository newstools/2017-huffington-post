The 16th annual Metro FM Awards took place at the Durban ICC on Saturday. Local rapper, Nasty C, cleaned up at this year's ceremony, walking away with four awards. He racked up: Best Hit Single, Best Male, Best Hip Hop and Song of The Year, Fan favourite, Amanda Black, won the coveted Listeners Choice Award and nabbed the trophy for Best R&B Single. Although Babes Wodumo scored four nominations this year, she unfortunately did not win in any of her categories. This didn't go down so well with some fans who made their feelings known on Twitter:       Some people put it all on the fans:     The EFF's Mbuyiseni Ndlozi also expressed his disappointment and alluded to people paying for their votes. She is the Queen that money can't buy! In #MMA16's that are up for sale, when u loose, u thank God! Babes Wodumo genuine all the way! pic.twitter.com/Wbb6tfOgiw   And just in case you missed it.
