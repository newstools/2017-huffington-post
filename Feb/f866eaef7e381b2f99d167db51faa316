You know what they say: After the show, it's the time for everyone to change into yet another fabulous look. At least when it comes to the Oscars, anyway. Sunday night's red carpet was full of elegance, sparkle, and golden gowns, but the after-party looks were hipper, cooler, and a lot more risky. Stars arrived at the Vanity Fair Oscar Party sporting dancing shoes, plunging necklines, thigh-high slits, more ACLU ribbons and even one wild bathing suit/dress hybrid. It's almost like the Oscars gowns won, but then everyone realized that the after-party gowns were the real winners. Sound familiar? Check out all of the gorgeous second looks of the night below.
