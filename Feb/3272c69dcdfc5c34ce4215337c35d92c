A photo of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and President Donald Trump is becoming a YUGE meme. On Monday, Trump had his first face-to-face meeting at the White House with Trudeau. The visit was cordial and as you can see from the clip below, the two had a totally normal handshake. nice smooth shake .. no jerks .. appropriately brief .. professional #TrudeauMeetsTrump pic.twitter.com/ACBd7r5WV1 It was a stark contrast from the oddly aggressive handshake Trump had with Shinzō Abe when the president hosted the Japanese prime minister last week. Ouch! Trump and Japanese PM Shinzō Abe's EPIC handshake. pic.twitter.com/gtX3mCwii8 Yet, there was a split second before Trump offered his hand to Trudeau and the Canadian PM took it that was captured by Reuters. And its undeniably funny. Naturally, as soon as the photo made its way to Twitter, users went crazy: Looks like someone saw that Shinzo Abe gif pic.twitter.com/MUsHfuxspc And thus a meme was born: We are all Justin Trudeau pic.twitter.com/vjJlQB8mOf @Mikeggibbs @ddale8 fixed it. pic.twitter.com/AHn9SNB4u9 US President Donald Trump opens meeting with Canadian PM Justin Trudeau by claiming entire Canadian Army could fit in the palm of one hand. pic.twitter.com/Kd5rcY3tCF *record scratch*
