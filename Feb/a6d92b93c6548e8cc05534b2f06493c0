In 1948, a black law student named Seretse Khama, who was also heir to the throne in Botswana, married a white English clerk named Ruth Williams. Their courtship sparked an international scandal right as apartheid was taking hold of neighboring South Africa. This month, Khama and Williams' story is the subject of "A United Kingdom," which premiered at last year's Toronto Film Festival. David Oyelowo plays Khama, and a charming Rosamund Pike plays Williams, a woman who had to adjust to life at the center of a fraught spotlight. Below, The Huffington Post has a gallery of exclusive photos showcasing the handsomely shot movie directed by Amma Asante ("Belle"). "A United Kingdom" opens Feb. 10.
