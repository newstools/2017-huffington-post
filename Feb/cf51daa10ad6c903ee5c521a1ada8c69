Disorderly behaviour in Parliament infringes on the rights of all South Africans, Cabinet has said. In a statement on Thursday, Cabinet raised concerns about the violence that again broke out in Parliament during President Jacob Zuma's State of the Nation Address (Sona). "Parliament is one of South Africa's founding democratic institutions established by the Constitution to uphold the Bill of Rights and account to the people of South Africa - - all of whom have entrusted us with the responsibility of leading them towards a better life", it said. Cabinet called on MPs to put the interests of South Africans first and reassert the role of the institution. This follows yet another Sona where the Economic Freedom Fighters and a Congress of the People MP were violently ejected from Parliament. Eight Parliament protection services officials and a number of EFF MPs were injured in the scuffle. Call for disciplinary action in patients' deaths
Cabinet also welcomed Zuma's address and reiterated the president's call to intensify efforts aimed at "driving radical economic transformation and efforts to fast-track implementation". Cabinet on Thursday also extended its condolences to the families and friends of mentally ill patients who died in Gauteng NGOs contracted by the province. The number of deaths has increased from 94 to more than 100, it was announced on Wednesday. "Cabinet further calls on Premier [David] Makhura to ensure that appropriate disciplinary action is taken against all who may have conducted themselves improperly or negligently," Cabinet said. It praised Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi for appointing the Health Ombudsman to investigate the matter. In the statement released a day after the Wednesday meeting of ministers there was no mention of the Cto storms such as Dineo." News 24
