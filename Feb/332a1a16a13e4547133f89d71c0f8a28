A Pennsylvania lawmaker didn’t mince words when he attacked Donald Trump after the president said that he would “destroy” the career of a Texas state senator who promotes asset forfeiture reform. Civil asset forfeiture allows law enforcement to seize cash and property from people who haven’t been convicted of a crime. “Who is the state senator?” Trump asked Sheriff Harold Eavenson of Rockwall County, Texas, on Tuesday. “Do you want to give his name? We’ll destroy his career.” State senator Daylin Leach (D-Montgomery) encouraged the president to come after his career instead. “Hey! I oppose civil forfeiture too,” Leach posted on Facebook Tuesday. He added: “Why don’t you come after me you fascist, loofa-faced shit-gibbon!!” He also posted the message on Twitter. Leach co-sponsored a bill that would require a criminal conviction before assets are seized. That bill is currently in committee, according to Philly Voice. It wasn’t the first time Trump has been called a shit-gibbon on the internet. A White House spokeswoman said Tuesday afternoon that Trump was “joking,” but that’s probably little comfort to Leach. In a statement given to Philly Voice, Leach’s spokesperson said the senator is “mad as hell.” “President Trump blithely talked about destroying the career of a man who disagreed with Trump on a policy issue,” spokesman Steve Hoenstine told the publication. “Then Trump laughed about it, which is just what you’d expect from someone who gets his kicks firing people on national television. Trump just continues to undermine democratic norms, America’s system of checks and balances, and the general principle of human decency.” His spokesman also tweeted about the incident. It doesn’t appear there will be apologies any time soon.
