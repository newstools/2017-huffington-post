Nickelodeon announced the nominees for the 2017 Kids' Choice Awards with "Daily Show" host Trevor Noah, actress Pearl Thusi, and Olympic gold medalist and 400m record holder Wayde van Niekerk cracking the nod as some of kids' favourite stars from around the world. They have been nominated in the new Favourite African Star category alongside Nigerian singer Yemi Alade, Nigerian actress Funke Akindele Bello, and Kenyan actress Lupita Nyong'o. Both Thusi and Noah call New York City home at the moment, with Thusi living there as she films TV show "Quantico" and Noah hosts "The Daily Show". üöï !!!!

With his focus on the 400m and now 200m distance, it is possible that he may come up against hero Usain Bolt at the World Championships in August 2017.
