Amid growing xenophobic violence, a group calling itself the Mamelodi Concerned Residents on Friday held a march in Tshwane to protest the presence of immigrants in the country.  The group handed over a memorandum at the Home Affairs Department, despite not receiving police clearance for their protest.  A spokesperson for the group, Oupa Mtshweni, said part of the memorandum's demands was for government to "stop telling foreigners to come to South Africa", and concerns around asylum-seekers, jobs and criminals.  While the group said they had planned a peaceful march, they were joined by a group from Atteridgeville and the event became violent.  Watch the video for more.
