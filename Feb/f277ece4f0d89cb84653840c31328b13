AfriForum is not the sort of organisation you'd think would have a Pinterest account. Or it's own GPS app, with Steve Hofmeyr's voice. Pinterest describes itself as "a visual bookmarking tool that helps you discover and save creative ideas". So it's used a lot by people following fashion or decorating, or travel or outdoor enthusiasts, usually with the focus on pictures rather than words. "Pinterest is the world's catalog of ideas. Find and save recipes, parenting hacks, style inspiration and other ideas to try," says Pinterest. AfriForum is using it to post photos of its supporters repainting roads, part of it's self-reliance campaign: Savefrom Uploaded by userCopyright issueNylstroom SelfdoenafriforumMaand van Selfstandigheid  Savefrom Uploaded by userCopyright issueNylstroom SelfdoenafriforumMaand van Selfstandigheid Savefrom Uploaded by userCopyright issueErmelo SelfdoenafriforumMaand van Selfstandigheid Savefrom Uploaded by userCopyright issueSasolburg SelfdoenafriforumMaand van Selfstandigheid This is the sort of stuff usually found on Pinterest: SaveBuzzFeedCopyright issueThis list has some good and some bad, but it's worth a glance, you might find an interesting read or five.Melanie BurnsBooks!!

AfriForum GPS is available in the app stores, "keeping you on track, with the voice of Steve Hofmeyr, all in Afrikaans!" It's a "complete mobile GPS" with national coverage and it's been downloaded 10,000 times. It's built by AfriGIS, which also built the official Gautrain app. There's also the main AfriForum app with info on the organisation. AfriForum is an Afrikaner rights organisation, part of the larger Solidarity movement. The Huffington Post SA has reported that, while AfriForum styles itself as a civic rights group, the focus is Afrikaner rights only and "in actual fact it could be described as South Africa's answer to the alt-right movement in the United States: strongly nationalistic, suspicious of government, antagonistic towards liberal or progressive values, opposed to immigration and integration and with a strong focus on ethnic mobilisation". It has been building parallel state structures — media, tertiary education, welfare and legal — with a policy of not relying on the state. Prosecutor advocate Gerrie Nel resigned to join AfriForum's new prosecution unit this week. AfriForum has more than 186,000 members with monthly fees of R50 and Solidarity almost 400,000 members.
