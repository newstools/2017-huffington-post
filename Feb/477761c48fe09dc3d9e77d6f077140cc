Mariah Carey is well aware that she's not a "regular" person. The singer sat down for an interview with Rolling Stone and the subject of her New Year's Eve performance came up. On Dec. 31, Carey took to the stage for ABC's "Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve." Instead of a dazzling performance to cap off 2016, she wound up ringing in the new year with a lip-synch disaster on live TV. Looking back, Carey says it "couldn't be helped." "It's just something where if I can't explain it to the entire world, then they're not going to understand it, because it's not what they do," Carey told Rolling Stone. "Just like I wouldn't understand somebody who had a desk job and how to do that. I couldn't. I literally am incapable of being in the real world and surviving." 2017 baby pic.twitter.com/xfJ7ngaoRD What followed the "mortifying" performance was a lot of he-said, she-said. Carey's reps blamed producers by saying they "set her up to fail." Clark's company denied responsibility and called the remarks made by her camp "defamatory." Today, Carey's doing her best to brush it all off. "I used to get upset by [controversy]," she told Rolling Stone. "This was out of my control, and had everything not been such a total chaotic mess, then I would have been able to make something happen. Even the dancers should have stopped dancing and helped me off the fucking stage. I'm sorry. It was a mess, and I blame everybody, and I blame myself for not leaving after rehearsal." And there you have it.
