Ava DuVernay used her platform at the Oscars ― and her gorgeous dress ― to make a powerful statement against Donald Trump at the awards show on Sunday. The Oscar-nominated director and screenwriter explained via Twitter why her look for the Academy Awards was “a small sign of solidarity.” “I chose to wear a gown by a designer from a majority Muslim country,” DuVernary tweeted from her account. “Thanks to @AshiStudio of Lebanon.” A small sign of solidarity. I chose to wear a gown by a designer from a majority Muslim country. Thanks to @AshiStudio of Lebanon. #Oscars pic.twitter.com/CbEkK7rCpG Designer Mohammed Ashi, who is from Saudi Arabia, launched Ashi Studio in Beirut, Lebanon in 2007, according to the brand’s website. DuVernay’s sign of solidarity seemed to reference Trump’s travel ban, a controversial executive order that primarily targeted Muslim-majority countries. Many people on Twitter thanked the director for taking a stand: @ava We love your gesture of solidarity and for being a #MuslimAlly at the #Oscars. We hope others will join you at https://t.co/z8c5WTz1QT. @ava And you look phenomenal! Thank you Ava for serving humanity so well. @ava @ashistudio yes Queen! Salute to your solidarity ✊🏽 @ava @ashistudio My cousin's husband and children are Lebanese. Thank you for sharing the beauty of the country. @ava @ashistudio Gorgeous--the gown, the sentiment, and you. Stunning. @ava @ashistudio way to represent! Before heading to the Oscars, DuVernay also made sure to recognize and remember Trayvon Martin five years after his death. “On my way to #Oscars. Taking a moment to remember #TrayvonMartin,” she wrote. “Our hoodies are still up and the movement is still strong. #OurSonTrayvon.” On my way to #Oscars. Taking a moment to remember #TrayvonMartin.
