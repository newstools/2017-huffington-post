Meek Mill disappointed a lot of fans on Friday night when he used Instagram’s Stories feature to post a series of videos showing a homeless man asking for some change. The video never actually shows the Philadelphia rapper, who reportedly has an estimated net worth of $3 million, handing the man money. However, it does show the 29-year-old telling the man to do pushups for $20. “We ain’t going to give out no free money,” Meek Mill can be heard saying in the video, which was still on the rapper’s Instagram account early Saturday evening. “You’re not going to give me $20,” the man tells Meek Mill and his friends, seemingly in disbelief. “Yes, I am,” the rapper replies. The next video shows the man doing 20 pushups as Meek Mill counts. Instagram stories are only available for 24 hours, but celebrity gossip site The Shade Room uploaded the rapper’s full video to its own Instagram account. #PressPlay: #MeekMill makes a homeless man do some push-ups for money. #Roommates, what are your thoughts? A post shared by The Shade Room (@theshaderoom) on Feb 25, 2017 at 8:17am PST Meek Mill flaunts his wealth on social media, sharing photos of his jewelry, watches and cars ― which makes his request for the homeless man seem all the more degrading. Not only does he appear to be making fun of the man, he seems to exploit him by sharing videos of him following orders with more than 11 million Instagram followers. Fans of the rapper were understandably let down. Meek Mill, there are more humane ways to be charitable. Share this slide:
