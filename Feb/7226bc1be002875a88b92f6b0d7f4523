If you're not quite ready to let "The Vampire Diaries" go, you're not alone. Nina Dobrev is also having a hard time saying goodbye. The 28-year-old actress filmed her last scene in the series Monday. Though Dobrev first left the show in 2015, she recently returned to reprise her role as Elena Gilbert for the finale. And if you thought her first farewell was rough, you better buckle up for the second. The actress wrote a beautiful letter on Instagram to bid the show adieu. A photo posted by Nina Dobrev (@ninadobrev) on Feb 6, 2017 at 2:50pm PST "It feels like it was just yesterday that I was saying goodbye," Dobrev wrote in her caption. "And yet two years have passed and here we are again. This is my true final goodbye, as today I shot my last scene of the Vampire Diaries forever." "Coming back for the series finale has been a whirlwind of emotion, nostalgia, love, tears of joy and bittersweet endings," she continued. "It feels like the beautiful closure we all needed, myself included, and I couldn't have been happier to come home to be with my TVD set family and friends." We're not crying. You're crying. The actress also had plenty of love to send her fans, who she believes will be happy with the finale. "From the bottom of my heart, I send you my biggest thanks for the countless years of implicit dedication, passion, support, and undying love from all the fans that have stuck with us," Dobrev wrote. She concluded her note by thanking "The Vampire Diaries" cast and crew, saying that she "grew up" on the set. "We are all pieces of a big puzzle and without every truly amazing cast and crew member, this magical puzzle would not be complete." If we're this emotional after reading a letter ― which you can read in full on Instagram ― we can't imagine how we'll feel watching the finale! Stock up on tissues, people. "The Vampire Diaries" series finale airs March 10 on The CW.
