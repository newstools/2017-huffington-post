On "MasterChef Junior," host and chef Gordon Ramsay comes off as gentle (and tender) as a (perfectly cooked) lamb. But his sensitive behavior on this competitive reality show is due to the fact that the participants happen to be kids. On any of his other shows, Ramsay lets his blunt, no-nonsense inner self purée contestants' egos to a frothy pulp —and his personality on Twitter is certainly no exception. Recently, people have been tweeting pictures of meals they've cooked at Ramsay and he's more than happy to give them his thoughts, though most of his reviews would make most people's blood boil. Here are 20 of Ramsay's most savage (and hilarious) reviews of people's dishes on Twitter: 1. 2. 3.
