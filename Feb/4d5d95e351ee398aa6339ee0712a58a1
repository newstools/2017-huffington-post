On "MasterChef Junior," host and chef Gordon Ramsay comes off as gentle (and tender) as a (perfectly cooked) lamb. But his sensitive behavior on this competitive reality show is due to the fact that the participants happen to be kids. On any of his other shows, Ramsay lets his blunt, no-nonsense inner self purée contestants' egos to a frothy pulp —and his personality on Twitter is certainly no exception. Recently, people have been tweeting pictures of meals they've cooked at Ramsay and he's more than happy to give them his thoughts, though most of his reviews would make most people's blood boil. Here are 20 of Ramsay's most savage (and hilarious) reviews of people's dishes on Twitter: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. @GordonRamsay judge my Valentine's Day themed vegetarian sriracha taco I made plz pic.twitter.com/fQEGIlgOxn 11. @GordonRamsay what do you think of this steak? pic.twitter.com/6HRGydQsDq 112. 13. 14. 15. 16. 17. @GordonRamsay hi what do you think of my cake I made thanks xo pic.twitter.com/xTnqzSeuYd Kitty did you drop it ? https://t.co/nFpqlg0Xh2 18. @GordonRamsay what do you think of these nachos pic.twitter.com/m6PM5BSXZS Lettuce Pray https://t.co/BHecmb2mW1 19. @GordonRamsay i made mushroom omelettes, first try, how's it look pic.twitter.com/s7a0h71A3I You need some serious egg-u-cating on making a perfect omelette https://t.co/h534UifXeT 2o. @GordonRamsay lets star in fifty shades of grey, you can pour me all over ur chest pic.twitter.com/yrWlkpJikk Now that's what I call weird.
