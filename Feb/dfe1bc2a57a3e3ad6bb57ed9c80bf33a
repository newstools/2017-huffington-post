Beauty vloggers have tried all kinds of crazy hacks to apply their makeup ― think socks, dish sponges, nipple covers or even silicone bra inserts. But condoms? That's one we hadn't seen before. YouTuber Itzayana Lizbeth tried the condom-blending technique in January, followed by fellow beauty vlogger Laila Tahri. In a new video that's making the rounds on the internet, Tahri says she experimenting with a sought-after version of a silicone makeup sponge called the SiliSponge and didn't love the results. So, she tried condoms. "I came up with this idea because I love using a sponge. But it absorbs so much product," she wrote in an Instagram post. "Using the condom around it, it doesn't absorb any product and it applies super smooth!" Tahri first washed off the lubrication, then inserted the sponge into the condom. She squirted the foundation on her new tool before dotting it on her face. The vlogger liked the results of the blending hack, but there was one major flaw. Watch the video above to see what happens (warning: there's a bit of NSFW language.) APPLYING MAKEUP WITH A CONDOM?! The video is now on my youtube channel. Link in my bio. _ If you watch my youtube video. You know that i washed the condom first. And i know i applied a wrong foundation shade. I fixed it later with the concealer. I was to lazy to take it off. _ I came up with this idea because of that i love using a sponge. But it absorbs so much product. With using the condom around it HAHA it doesnt absorb any product and it applies super smooth! ________ @anastasiabeverlyhills brow pro palette (used Ebony) & modern renaissance @labelle_uk @amadea_dashurie matte liquid lipsticks Vamp Addict & Pink Latte & Nude Souffle (used on lips and eyes) @yourlashesofficial lashes Nasira @girlactik matte bronzer cabo @gorgeouscosmeticsofficial conceal it light natural @motivescosmetics shimmer powder Bombshell @zwitsalofficial baby powder @contourcosmetics all day spray @lorealmakeup infallible 24h foundation ___ Brushes @anastasiabeverlyhills 7B, A25, A3, A28, A23 @sigmabeauty F25, F66 @motivescosmetics powder @realtechniques sponge ____ @wakeupandmakeup @hudabeauty @eyelive4beauty @shimycatsmua @maryhadalittleglam @allmodernmakeup @slaysolutely @makeupforbarbies @thebeautybombb @nikkietutorials A video posted by LAILA • TAHRI (@lailatahri) on Feb 5, 2017 at 10:02am PST The HuffPost Lifestyle newsletter will make you happier and healthier, one email at a time.
