He’s back! Former President Barack Obama has finally returned from his post-presidency vacation, where he got some much-deserved R&R in Palm Springs, California, and on Richard Branson’s private escape in the British Virgin Islands. While Obama’s vacation style consisted of a backward hat and flip-flops, he looked seriously dapper in New York City on Friday in a black suit and a white collared shirt. No tie necessary. Twitter took notice. The former president enjoyed a night out with daughter Malia. The two dined at Emilio’s Ballato, a popular Italian restaurant in Little Italy. (And happily posed for photos.) #aboutlastnight #epic #44 at Table #1 @emiliosballatonyc #littleitaly  @nolita.newyork You know what's up! #president @barackobama & @obama.malia #italiansdoitbetter🇮🇹 #usa🇺🇸 @gennaro.pecchia @menwhodine @aosbysosa @chefangelososa @truecooks @zagat @thegordinier  #emiliosballato #nyc #cheflife #menwhodine #teamnosleep #ftw A post shared by MenWhoDine (@menwhodine) on Feb 24, 2017 at 6:51am PST They also saw the Roundabout Theatre Co.’s production of Arthur Miller’s “The Price” at the American Airlines Theater, starring Mark Ruffalo, Jessica Hecht, Tony Shalhoub and Danny DeVito. Some theater-goers didn’t even notice who was in the audience with them. Welcome back, Sir! Share this slide:
