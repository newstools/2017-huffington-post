The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) announced on Wednesday it has found the largest batch of "Earth-Size, Habitable-Zone Planets" orbiting around a single star, called TRAPPIST-1. "All of these seven planets could have liquid water — key to life as we know it — under the right atmospheric conditions, but the chances are highest with the three in the habitable zone," said NASA. They're 40 light-years (235 trillion miles) from Earth, in the constellation Aquarius, but NASA calls that "relatively close".
