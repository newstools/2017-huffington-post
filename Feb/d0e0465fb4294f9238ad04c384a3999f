From the minute President Jacob Zuma walked through the doors of Parliament's chambers, it was clear he was not going to have an easy night. The Economic Freedom Fighters chanted "tsotsi", the ANC tried to shout "ANC" over them and everything went downhill from there. Watching from the gallery the whole time? Former president Thabo Mbeki â€” and he didn't look impressed at all. Enough said.......... #SONA2017 pic.twitter.com/BNazsXPnAr  Of course everyone tried to guess what Mbeki must be thinking to himself. @ntlokom what most SANE ANC leaders are thinking, South Africa is in shambles!!  @ntlokom ðŸŽ¶ That should be me, holding your hand
That should be me, making you laugh
That should be me, this is so sad
That should be me ðŸŽ¶  @ntlokom @sherwiebp thinking.... bullshhh  We asked people to say what he was thinking in one word. @huffpostsa mad!  This guy made a whole sentence one word. He's our favourite. ðŸ˜‚ @HuffPostSA "They-threw-me-out-for-this-disaster?" (That's one word! Lol)
