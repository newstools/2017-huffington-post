Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter, the closest thing the United States of America has to a queen, announced on the first day of Black History Month that she is pregnant with twins. For a moment, all seemed good in the world. And all was. We would like to share our love and happiness. We have been blessed two times over. We are incredibly grateful  that our family will be growing by two, and we thank you for your well wishes. - The Carters A photo posted by Beyoncé (@beyonce) on Feb 1, 2017 at 10:39am PST There’s some question about what this means for Beyoncé’s scheduled Coachella performance in April after TMZ reported that some of the top people at AEG Live, which puts on the festival, didn’t know about the pregnancy. But those concerns discount Beyoncé’s ability to overcome all odds all the time. Anyway, to Twitter we go. WE MUST NOT LET TRUMP AND BANNON DISTRACT US FROM WHAT’S GOING ON. RESIST. RESIST. THIS IS F*CKING SERIOUS. WAIT HOLD ON WHO IS HAVING TWINS Beyoncé and Jay Z’s twins will join their five-year-old big sister Blue Ivy Carter. Share this slide:
