Cream-cheese pastries recipe Ingredients: 1-2 sheets ready-made puff pastry 25ml basil or coriander pesto handful of baby tomatoes, sliced 1 tub cream cheese 50g feta cheese 1 chicken breast fillet, sliced 1 ripe avocado pear, peeled and sliced micro herbs, to serve Instructions: 1. Unroll the pastry onto a clean surface. Use a ruler and sharp knife to cut the pastry into rectangles. Put the rectangles onto a greased and lined baking tray. 2. Use the knife to mark a border around the edge of each rectangle (don't cut right through). Use a fork to prick the pastry on the inside of the border of each rectangle. 3. Bake in preheated oven at 180oC for 15 minutes or until the pastry is puffed up and golden. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool. 4. Mix the pesto and tomatoes together and set aside. 5. Once pastry has cooled spread the cream cheese into the middle of each rectangle. Top some with the tomatoes and feta and some with sliced chicken and avocado. Garnish with micro herbs and serve immediately.
