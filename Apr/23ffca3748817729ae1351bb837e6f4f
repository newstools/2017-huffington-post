Jonas was the keynote speaker at the event. He added that "everything we did was to advance the cause of the country". Jonas was the first keynote speaker at the event. Last week, Jonas and the finance minister, Pravin Gordhan, were fired in a late-night Cabinet reshuffle, along with nine ministers and nine deputy ministers.
