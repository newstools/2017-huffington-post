ANALYSIS White people are mad at Max Du Preez for calling out their delayed outrage. Late on Monday night, which was dubbed #BlackMonday by some, the journalist posted this tweet: Of course some people were not happy about his broad generalisation rushing for the all-time favourite defence "not all whites", which was perfectly ripped to shreds by Muhammad Ali in 1971. Cue everyone's fave in the "I fought against apartheid even though I'm white brigade", Helen Zille.  Du Preez was definitely ready for her with a beautiful "OK Caption Obvious" swipe.  Then there were those who called Du Preez' tweet a distraction because obviously there are more pressing issues than calling out whiteness.  @MaxduPreez Is this really the time to be devisive? You're just playing into their hands.  Luckily some people understood his point and shared his views.   And then came the "what about those who didn't know" question. With apt responses from Du Preez.  @SdixonSharon Most people didn't want to know, as former Nat minister Leon Wessels told the TRC  @MaxduPreez Could they have been, though?Old farts who were alive then tell us they didn't know due to effective govt propaganda.Also, if ifs & buts... @MarkBarnard10 Tell those old farts they're lying. They didn't want to know. I'm an ordinary white middle class Afrikaner and I knew Some black people couldn't resist responding to this one pointing out obvious scenarios where "we didn't know" doesn't seem believable. @MandlaMkhize @MaxduPreez Those whites only signs on the beach and bus stops and restaurants, what did they think they mean??? pic.twitter.com/RUr30YHE4U  The outrage may be there all the time but truth is it appears to be inconsistent. That's the bottom line. @MaxduPreez pic.twitter.com/l3Jr0eD2D4  Also, yes, white people need to keep talking to each other about this. We've been having this conversation for long enough.
