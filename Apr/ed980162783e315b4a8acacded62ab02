Whether you choose Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn or Pinterest as your channel of choice, social media is an easy and inexpensive way to engage with your people, get more feet to your website, reach new audiences and generate leads. The good news is that if you strategise, it becomes easier. First of all, create a social media calendar and dream up a "theme" for each day of the week. This will help you to focus and not panic when the time comes to post. Remember, people do business with people, stories sell and images are the only way to go because 90% of information transmitted to the brain is visual. Next populate your calendar with the following seven simple yet stupendous topics: How does a social media manager spend their day?
