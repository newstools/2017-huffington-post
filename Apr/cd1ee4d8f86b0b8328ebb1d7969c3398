It seems there is a Japanese festival for everything. Right now the Penis Festival is underway or, as it's officially known in Japanese, Kanamara Matsuri. This term translates into English as "Festival of the Steel Phallus". かなまら祭り。今年は人に担がれてたエリザベスみこし A post shared by @yuuichiro_wasai on Apr 2, 2017 at 2:39am PDT  A post shared by Sascha Okamoto (@luvbrace) on Apr 3, 2017 at 5:59pm PDT  The phallus, being the central theme of the event, is depicted everywhere. Illustrations, floats, figurines, carved vegetables and decorations. These guys have it all! During the event, large penises are paraded through the streets of Kawasaki Japan, where festival goers can be seen taking photos with the phallic objects and even buying memorabilia.    There is however, an important social element behind the event. The festival, which started in 1969, aims to raise awareness for sexual health and works to celebrate fertility. This objective is said to have grown out of a Japanese legend. The legend involves a woman who had a demon living in her vagina. When she attempted to become pregnant the demon bit off not one, but two penises that attempted to impregnate her. The problem was only overcome when she went to a blacksmith, who fashioned her a steel penis. The demon broke its teeth on the steel phallus and it was only then that she was able to live a normal life. It's ultimately for a great cause, as all the profits raised from the event go to HIV research. So there has never been a better reason to visit Japan. Lovely photo from the famous #kanamaramatsuri a.k.a the penis festival of #Japan . The festival celebrates fertility, std prevention, easy delivery, and harmony between married couples. P.S. I think the cherry blossoms in the back add a nice touch. #culture #travel #travelgram #sakura #festivals A post shared by Jamila Brown (@le_millz) on Apr 4, 2017 at 9:10pm PDT  今年はgetできたよ @a1a1036 lol #kanamaramatsuri #人多すぎ 通称 あやか祭り @ayk_218 あやちゃんがいっぱいしゃぶられてたよ🤤あっちがう！祀られてたよ!!w A post shared by Natsumi_821 (@natsumi_821) on Apr 3, 2017 at 7:37pm PDT  kodakara candy #penisfestival #peniscandy #kanamara#kanamaramatsuri A post shared by Koji Hirai (@kopirai) on Apr 3, 2017 at 11:55pm PDT  #Japan #Kawasaki #kanamaramatsuri #travel #traveljournalist A post shared by @marinaskyf777 on Apr 5, 2017 at 4:07am PDT
