Just when you thought the Beckham clan couldn't get any cuter, they went and added another one to the brood -- an adorable baby duckling. Celebrating the Easter weekend with his family, David Beckham added some adorable snaps to Instagram of himself and 12-year-old son Cruz holding the yellow fuzzball. Cue heart-melting.
