Tina Fey threw out one-liner after one-liner while co-hosting “Stand for Rights: A Benefit for the ACLU” on Friday night. She started out by poking fun at her status as a “stay-at-home actress” before tossing some burns Donald Trump’s way, notably claiming that the president gave up assaulting women for Lent. “Earlier tonight, in what is surely an April Fools’ joke, the president proclaimed that next month will be National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month, so now we know what he gave up for Lent.” Fey, who mentioned that she had “gay birds” on her shirt, also said, “The president and I have two things in common. One, neither of us has any business wearing khakis with a shirt tucked in, and two, we’re both very upset about the amount of fake news out in the world right now. So, don’t let any website tell you that the ACLU stands for Anti Christian Lesbian Underground. It’s the American Christian Lesbian Underground.” But Trump wasn’t the only member of the administration to be Fey prey. She also made a jab at Vice President Mike Pence. “Luckily, Mike Pence isn’t allowed to go down and shut Planned Parenthood unless his wife goes with him. So, if we can just keep Karen busy scrapbooking, we can all still get Pap smears.” Lastly, we’ll end with this additional notable moment from Fey’s monologue: “Did you know that women still only make one ‘Ghostbusters’ movie to every two made by men? And men average ‘Ocean’s Eleven’ for every ‘Ocean’s Eight’ that goes to women. That is simply unacceptable.” All hail the Queen, Tina Fey. Ready to give?
