Sure, some people only see their cousins at family reunions ― along with other distant relatives. But for those lucky to enough to call a cousin a best friend ― myself included ― life is pretty damn great. Having a cousin for a bestie means you have a sidekick at family events and someone to vent to when your parents or siblings are being annoying. But most importantly, you know that they're always there for you. Below are some truths about having a cousin for a BFF: Likely with wine in hand, ready to gossip about all the family drama. Plus, if you have to split the last slice of pumpkin pie, it may as well be with each other. If something ridiculous happens, your cousin is the first person you reach out to on the sly. And there's no one else either of you would rather have at the altar when you say "I do." Your cousin is not afraid to call you out when you're being moody, and you're not scared to tell them that their hairstyle looks lame. You're stuck with each other for life, so you might as well be honest. And they're not afraid to remind you of it. That includes, but is not limited to, making fun of your old school photos, poor style choices or nerdy hobbies. (Beanie Baby collecting, anyone?) Your sister is being insufferable? Your cousin is always there to give you some sound wisdom. Their significant other is driving them bonkers? You're there to talk it out over lunch. It runs in the family, after all. Because it's their family, too, and they know how ridiculous the clan can be. It's always helpful to have an ally when grandma asks when you're going to start dating. Hand-me-downs are totally okay when they come from your cousin's closet. Or accidentally calling you by the other one's name. But this is more of a compliment than an annoyance. You guys are siblings at heart and best friends for life. What's better than that?
