Usually "read it and weep" is said jokingly, but in the case of Charlie Murphy's final tweet, we mean it literally: If you read it, you will weep. Murphy, a comedian known for telling stories about Rick James and Prince on "Chappelle's Show" and the brother of Eddie Murphy, died on Wednesday following a battle with leukemia. He reportedly kept his illness so under wraps that he didn't even tell his co-stars on "Power." Despite the secrecy, the final tweet from Murphy's Twitter account speaks volumes. Sent the night before he died, Murphy wrote, "One to Sleep On: Release the past to rest as deeply as possible." One to Sleep On: Release the past to rest as deeply as possible. Murphy's account supposedly sent out another tweet the next morning, but it was deleted. (It may have been scrubbed because it's a quote misattributed to Abraham Lincoln.) For whatever reason, the last tweet is Murphy's message about releasing the past. @shlexii @Catherin3_ @JoeFromThePub @dannyprovo Don't see the point of it being taken down aye. But damn RIP! pic.twitter.com/xMjFnTRdWE The comedian was consistently active on Twitter, regularly sending out inspirational messages starting with "Rise & Grind" and "One to Sleep On." One to Sleep On: If you could change one thing about the world, what would it be? He even recently posted a tribute to Prince, nearly a year after the musician's death in April 2016. Can't believe it's been almost a year!? RIP to the Purple One https://t.co/SvSO1WO49i One of the most popular "Chappelle's Show" sketches was Murphy telling a story about getting smoked by Prince in basketball. As many fans are saying, good luck with the rematch in Heaven, Charlie. @charliemurphy How Prince greeted Charlie Murphy when he arrived in heaven pic.twitter.com/L2HNDqx85e
