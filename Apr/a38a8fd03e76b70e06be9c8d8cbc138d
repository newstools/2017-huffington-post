A 19-year-old aspiring model and college student has gotten a lot of attention for shutting down a troll who criticized her dark skin. A Twitter account that celebrates African beauty, @_AFRICANS_, shared three of Mimi Mbah’s photos with their more than 17,000 followers on March 31. The response Mbah received was overwhelmingly positive, but one Twitter user threw in his unwarranted two cents to say, “[If] she was lighter, she’d be fire.” @PhillyTheBoss @DukeOfZamunda @_AFRICANS_ @dopelike_mimi It she was lighter, she'd be fire 🔥🔥🔥 The Cameroonian teen clapped back by informing the troll that she’s perfect in the skin she’s in. “No thanks,” she tweeted Sunday. “I wouldn’t trade my skin color for the world! Still [fire] tho.” Mbah’s tweet has received more than 21,000 retweets and 58,000 favorites. Folks gave her lots of praise for standing up to the hate.  @dopelike_mimi @HotAsHelen_ I know you don't need my confirmation at all, but I agree that you truly are beautifully made as you are. Keep shining, sister. @xTranceFanatic @dopelike_mimi I'm confused why he had the audacity to criticize a goddess to her face. She slays 🔥🔥🔥 The Gaithersburg, Maryland, native told BuzzFeed News that she’s encountered this kind of ignorance toward her dark skin before, but she was still disappointed. She shared some of the other anti-black comments she received on her Instagram. All this for some attention ... I'm done entertaining them tho !
