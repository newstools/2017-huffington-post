Former transport minister Dipuo Peters, who resigned as an MP after losing her job in President Jacob Zuma's reshuffle, has been taking to the airwaves to describe her feelings. Peters, who on Wednesday told reporters that she was happy she was getting out while she could still walk and talk, spoke out on Power FM.  She said her removal as minister showed her what was important in life. "I didn't give my children the attention they needed, that's my regret. And you give your time & this happens" Abamama ðŸ‘€ðŸ™Š https://t.co/KJcZS6apZw  Peters was asked how she felt about losing her post to Joe Maswanganyi, and whether she took it as a reflection that President Jacob Zuma did not think she was doing a good job.
