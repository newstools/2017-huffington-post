Tess Holliday has put an Uber driver on blast via social media for allegedly questioning if she was healthy because of her size. The 31-year-old model and fat positive activist posted an Instagram video on Tuesday evening of her driver asking her what her "cholesterol" is. According to Holliday, the driver told her there was no way she could possibly be healthy because she is fat. Hey @uber I don't pay more to use your "black car" service to be told that there's no way I could possibly be healthy because I'm fat & then questioning it. No one should have to tolerate this at any level of the services you offer. I'm fat. I also have a fat wallet & will no longer be using your services. Ever. Also after I told him I was healthy he turned the radio off & changed the subject. #putmymoneywheremymouthis #uberdriver #uber Edited to add: saying my driver is fat was obviously being used as a descriptor & not to insult him. Also I did not show his face or use his name when filming, it was to be able to show what I deal with daily & why this behavior is unacceptable from anyone.

In 2015, she created the popular hashtag #EffYourBeautyStandards in order to celebrate bodies of all shapes and sizes.
