A few elderly women were seen protesting on Beyers Naude in Johannesburg singing "Zuma Must Go".  As Tito Mboweni pointed out, even if you don't believe Zuma needs to go, these women would have made your day.  Of course people caught onto this quickly and now there's a #ZumaMustGoChallenge which is hilarious. So far this remix is winning and we are pretty sure there are more we haven't see yet.  Tag us in yours on Twitter @HuffPostSA and on Facebook HuffPost South Africa and we'll add them to the list.
