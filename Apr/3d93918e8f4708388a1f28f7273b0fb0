A few elderly women were seen protesting on Beyers Naude in Johannesburg singing "Zuma Must Go". These old ladies have even made a little dance of how #ZumaMustFall #AntiZumaMarches #BayersNaude #sabcnews pic.twitter.com/gBhIfqqkUO  As Tito Mboweni pointed out, even if you don't believe Zuma needs to go, these women would have made your day. On a lighter note on a very serious day. These magogos win the day. The passion for their country is great. Whichever position one takes. üëåüèø  Of course people caught onto this quickly and now there's a #ZumaMustGoChallenge which is hilarious. So far this remix is winning and we are pretty sure there are more we haven't see yet.  Tag us in yours on Twitter @HuffPostSA and on Facebook HuffPost South Africa and we'll add them to the list.  #ZumaMustGo #Remix #InstaGrannies #AntiZumaMarches  #ZumaMustFall #TrapRemix #Lol #Trap #HipHopGrannies #SaveSA #JunkCrunk #Protests pic.twitter.com/03KUPuqDqq THANK YOU SOUTH AFRICA #zumamustgo #zumamustgochallenge pic.twitter.com/g9704mhtvZ LET ME JOIN the game #Zumamustgochallenge pic.twitter.com/W9zz1XcvRD #Zumamustgochallenge #zumamustgo #unite pic.twitter.com/WrakC6Xcrf #AntiZumaMarches #zumamustgochallenge pic.twitter.com/5Fed614caf Everywhere and anywhere pic.twitter.com/OUdY8vGaPY #ZumaMustGoChallenge pic.twitter.com/tJxAA7P7hJ
