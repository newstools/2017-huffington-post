The man suspected of carrying out a chilling homicide in Cleveland that was filmed and shared on Facebook was found dead Tuesday in Erie, Pennsylvania, from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, authorities said. Pennsylvania State Police said Steve Stephens, 37, was spotted by authorities Tuesday morning and shot and killed himself after "a brief pursuit." Stephens was wanted for the aggravated murder of 74-year-old Robert Godwin Sr. Steve Stephens was spotted this morning by PSP members in Erie County. After a brief pursuit, Stephens shot and killed himself. Cleveland police issued a warrant for Stephens' arrest on Sunday night after a video from around 2 p.m. that day was posted on his Facebook page. The footage appeared to capture Stephens complaining about a woman before approaching Godwin and shooting him at close range. Godwin, who apparently did not know Stephens, had been walking home from an Easter meal with his family on the city's northeast side near I-90. Police say Stephens apparently selected Godwin at random. Authorities searched for Stephens across the city on Sunday, but speculated that he may have left the state in a white Ford Fusion. They alerted residents of Pennsylvania, New York, Indiana and Michigan that he was on the run and considered armed and dangerous. The FBI as well as other statewide law enforcement joined the Cleveland PD's efforts on Sunday and offered a $50,000 reward for information leading to Stephens' arrest. Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf (D) praised the state police for their efforts and said he was "thankful no one in PA was hurt." Thank you to the brave @PAStatePolice troopers for their vigilance in pursuing the Facebook killer. Thankful no one in PA was hurt. https://t.co/GN5i6jkcuI Share this slide:
