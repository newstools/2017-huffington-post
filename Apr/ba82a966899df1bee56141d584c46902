"This is indeed a day when we should be thanking you for a number of things. Thank you for teaching us that now is not the time to be weak and frail, but to be courageous with them... not to share a platform with our enemies or walk shoulder to shoulder with them but to show them that the ANC lives and the ANC leads.

While it is unclear who is footing the bill, eNCA reported that the event appeared to be coordinated by the ANC and not government. Thousands of people are expected to attend, once again braving the wet and cold weather. Zuma is expected to address the crowd. It's been reported that the ANCYL will mobilise supporters from Gauteng and surrounding areas to attend the event. Zuma, who turns 75 today, shares his birthday with sacked finance minister Pravin Gordhan. And with that, the crowd has begun to disperse. #DayOfAction someone trying to address crowd after Malema, but people moving along. BB   Malema launched a scathing attack on Zuma and said that it was important to listen to elders like former presidents Thabo Mbeki and Kgalema Motlanthe who have called on ANC MPs to vote with their consciences during the vote of no confidence debate. Malema: we want to thank President Motlanthe, President Mbeki for speaking out. They have no interest, let's listen to them  #OppositionMarch Malema "A revolution takes time. You will look back and say you stood up" SM  #OppositionMarch Malema: we want to thank our civil society groups and unions. The message is reaching home.  EFF leader Julius Malema said the opposition had gathered "with the purpose of uniting our country". "Zuma is going to leave office... this office belongs to the people of South Africa... this is not the Nkandla compound. He must go back to the village." Malema said Zuma could only look after cattle. He said the marchers had no memorandum because Zuma could not read. "... someone who does not have a relationship with books. We don't want to waste paper and ink..." Malema said the march was not a once-off event. "This is rolling mass action. We are coming to Free State, Western Cape, Mpumalanga... "If not wanting Zuma is racist, then we are racist. If not wanting Zuma means we have received money from white people, then we are proud to have received money from white people... we are here to defend the country of our children," he said.

The DA's Phumzile van Damme said: "They tried to divide us, telling us we were racists but all South Africans want Zuma to phuma!" The ACDP's Wayne Thring said that the march would be the end of the road for Zuma. He said the firing of Pravin Gordhan was the straw that broke the camels back of South Africans, and that this march was not a racist march. "What was Pravin's crime? It was none other than he was competent," Thring said. #NationalDayofAction Let this day be marked as the beginning of the fall of Jacob Zuma - ACDP   The official programme is under way outside the Union Buildings.

Dancing to the song, "Zupta must fall." #NationalDayofAction @News24 pic.twitter.com/AMkNDuDQ8T   The call for Zuma to fall could not have come on a more unfortunate day for the President: his birthday. And not only is it his birthday, but Zuma shares his special day with Pravin Gordhan. Huffington Post SA editor-at-large Ferial Haffajee writes that while the two share a birthday, they could not be further apart on the political divide. Read her analysis here. This supporter took the call for Zuma to fall a step further. (Wait for the remix.)  The Freedom Front Plus has warned that while it does not oppose the march, opposition parties should ensure that the impact of the action is not lost by overdoing it. FF Plus leader Dr Pieter Groenewald said: "Protest actions that arise spontaneously from the public also carries more weight since the ANC will downplay any action coming from political parties as mere political point scoring. Spontaneous action from the public will also not be so easy to dismiss as insignificant and the government will have to take notice of the problem. In this regard, the FF Plus also call on church and spiritual leaders to give guidance where the moral decay in the ANC must be addressed strongly. "The FF Plus participated in the march of SaveSA last Friday in solidarity with the citizens of the country, and will also participate in the action planned by SaveSA on 18 April when the motion of no confidence against pres Zuma will be debated in parliament. "The FF Plus will definitely support the motion of no confidence." (Read the full statement here." Numbers are growing at Church Square in Pretoria ahead of the march. Hundreds of supporters from the EFF and the DA have arrived, along with several other opposition parties. The UDM's Bantu Holomisa told Huffington Post SA that he would be satisfied with 5000 supporters today, but the police are preparing for up to 10 000. #DA members gathering in #Tshwane for today's #NationalDayofAction pic.twitter.com/0LFIN8mcY5  Numbers growing in #ChurchSquare for #NationalDayofAction #OppositionPartiesMarch
