Everyone knows that morning sickness is a bugger. In fact, I would go as far to say it's quite a serious design fault. Why, after however many months of trying to conceive would your body reward your success with three solid months (or more!) of your worst stinking hangover EVERY. SINGLE. DAY? I'm talking the morning after, when you can feel the vodka shots still swirling around your stomach, when you can hardly move without making a dash to chat to Huey on the big white telephone. When even the world's dirtiest fry up doesn't take the edge off. Yep, that, but worse... much, much worse. Because here is the thing, you may be sustaining a brand new life inside of you, but your life doesn't stop. You will still need to work/look after your children/speak to your husband/console your mother/cook dinner/clean the house/stay awake past 3pm and all sorts of other seemingly impossible things. When all you'll want to do is lie in bed and sleep your way through the never-ending nausea. Despite now being on my third pregnancy, in those first few months I still found myself googling "morning sickness cures" in despair, hoping to find something... anything that would be more helpful than sodding ginger and adapting a "grin and bare it" attitude. But I couldn't. So now I am through to the other side into the comparatively dreamy realms of the second trimester, I thought I would share my view of what some idiot rudely called "morning sickness" (come on, everyone know it lasts all bloody day).         The delights of the second trimester are just around the corner...
