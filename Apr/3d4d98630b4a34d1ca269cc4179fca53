"Zanele Ngumbela, EWN, Braamfontein," is probably how this interview should have ended.  When a fire engulfed the Braampark on Tuesday, reporters were on the scene recording eyewitness accounts of what happened. An EWN reporter posted a video of Ngumbela who works in the office park on Twitter and to say people were impressed would be an understatement. Ngumbela's account was so detailed people wondered if she was auditioning for a job.  @ewnreporter The way this lady she's reporting She's on fire two ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ Ngumbela's report was detailed. With suave, she breezed through the basic tenets of journalism -- the "5Ws" -- who; what; when; where, and she ended the report by telling us that the "why" was yet to be determined.   The best part of the report was when Ngumbela recalled that she first joked about the fire when she saw it because she didn't realise it was real. She busts into a song and dance: "The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire," swiftly returning to her report after that.    She was so good, people agreed that she needed a job in journalism. Someone even went as far as asking Julius Malema how many RTs would lead to her getting a job but we're not sure he has such powers. @ewnreporter ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥wow somebody give her a journalism job already! ðŸ˜‚ this is talent!ðŸ”¥  And if journalism doesn't work out, maybe she could be spokesperson? @ewnreporter She can be the Spokesperson ðŸ˜‚.  She might have just changed the game though, so video reporters better up their game. @ewnreporter She's coming for your jobs...... Your reporters are SHOOOOK!!  Well done, Zanele! @ewnreporter Good reporting around this fire ðŸ”¥ pic.twitter.com/0sftYpZLJy
