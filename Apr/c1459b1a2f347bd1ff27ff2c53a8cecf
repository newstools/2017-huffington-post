He’ll always be her ... backup dancer? Mariah Carey and boyfriend Bryan Tanaka have reportedly split after five months of dating, according to TMZ. The couple, who found love amidst Carey’s crumbling engagement to billionaire James Packer, documented their relationship on the singer’s reality TV series “Mariah’s World” this past year. The two reportedly haven’t seen or spoken to each other since their vacation to Cabo at the end of March. Apparently, it was Carey’s ex-husband Nick Cannon, not Packer, who had a role to play in the couple’s demise. According to TMZ, Tanaka was jealous over the pair’s more-than-cordial relationship, which made the dancer feel “disrespected.” Things reportedly reached a boiling point when Carey showed up to the Nickelodeon Kids’ Choice Awards last month with Cannon and their children, 5-year-old twins Morocco and Monroe. In retaliation, Tanaka would reportedly “lash back” at the “I Don’t” singer by flirting with other women in front of her. The outlet also notes that finances put a strain on their relationship, as Tanaka reportedly developed expensive tastes during his time with Carey. She eventually put her foot down, however, after paying for his designer shoes, watches and chains. His spending habits and mistrust of Cannon apparently confirmed Carey’s suspicions that Tanaka stuck around for the fame after her split with Packer. No matter what happens, they’ll always have New Year’s Eve. The Huffington Post has reached out to Carey’s representatives and will update this post accordingly. Share this slide:
