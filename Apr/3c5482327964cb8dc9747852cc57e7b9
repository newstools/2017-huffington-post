Kim Kardashian's hopes of having a third child just got a harsh reality check. On "Keeping Up With The Kardashians" Sunday, the reality star underwent unsuccessful surgery to repair her uterus and was told carrying another baby would be too dangerous. "Not only has this been really painful, but now hearing that I can't carry any more kids, it couldn't get any worse," she said, per E! News. "I mean, f**k, like I really tried everything and I really want this and it's just not going to happen for me." "I give up," she said, per People. The news prompted Kardashian to rethink her options with husband Kanye West and "see what we're comfortable with." When Kourtney Kardashian broached the subject of surrogacy, Kim Kardashian appeared open to the possibility. "After talking to Kanye, I think that I always knew that surrogacy was an option, but I didn't think it was that realistic of an option. Now, I feel like that's my reality." "I feel like surrogacy really is the only other option for me." In an episode last November, Kardashian mentioned the possibility of surrogacy to mother Kris Jenner, saying she wanted to "explore" it. Kardashian, 36, experienced complications in the birth of North, now 3, and Saint, now 1.
