So you marched on Friday. You heeded the call of Save SA when the organisation said, "It is increasingly clear that coordinated, united public protest is the only way to stop further state capture and to defend our democracy, and the only way to get rid of Zuma." You wanted to defend democracy. You wanted to stop a rogue president who is destroying the future of the country. Perhaps you were moved by the Democratic Alliance, which called for you to march "for change." You may have encouraged others to do so. To seize upon this moment, to unite all citizens, to encourage all people to put aside their differences and march for a common cause. Perhaps it was the first time ever that you've done this. You were moved by the call for people to do something. You stood up, and you said, "enough is enough." You made sure that your voice, in whatever small way you could, was heard. You now wonder how this moment can grow. How it can be used to unite more South Africans under this newfound feeling of common purpose that you now feel so strongly. I'm afraid I have bad news for you. This march? That was the easy part of coalition-building. That was the entr√©e. Now the real, hard work begins. The work of joining the rest of South Africa, who have been suffering under the weight of poverty, unemployment and inequality.   Will you show up for these issues too? Or do they not count as national crises?  There will be no mass movement in South Africa without at least an understanding of what the poor face every day. Until their issues become everyone's issues, and their protests become as valid as anyone else's, and just as deserving of respect and protection, then the anti-Zuma demonstration will be just that. A pleasant day out.
