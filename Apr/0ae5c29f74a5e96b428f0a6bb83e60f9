South Africa has come to know the newly appointed co-host of Metro FM's The Front Row, Lerato Kganyago, as the rising radio and TV star she is today. Kganyago joined Bonang Matheba as co-host and producer of the show. Matheba since resigned, saying it was not because of Kganyago but because of how Metro FM handled the changes. Kganyago has now been joined by Dineo Ranaka on the show. She has come under fire from critics, and came out against them, defending her decisions.  But Kganyago was once a young girl with a dream, just like the rest of us. So we decided to take a look at her life from her time as Miss Jam Alley (we had to dig deep for that one too), to the powerhouse media personality she has become. On Tuesday, she took to Twitter to hit back at users who labelled her the "lite" version of Matheba. Kganyago said she was excited to be joining forces with Ranaka to deliver the best show. "Thank you for tuning in, Dineo Ranaka is a gem and a sister. [I'm] super excited to be working with her," Kganyago tweeted on Tuesday.  We're so proud of the woman she's become.
