Jennifer Lawrence is known for bringing a delightful dose of realness to high-fashion settings. And she's at it again in Dior's new fall 2017 ad campaign, wearing a message of feminism we can all applaud. In the photos, Lawrence wears relaxed-fit jeans, necklaces including a choker and a "We Should All Be Feminists" T-shirt that retails for a not-so-casual $710 (R9718,33) according to InStyle. The shirt, a nod to author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's famous TED talk, was sold on Saks Fifth Avenue's website through March 28, but remains available in Dior boutiques through May 15, Us Magazine reports. A portion of the proceeds will go to Rihanna's Clara Lionel Foundation, which funds educational programs around the world. We should all be feminists, but it doesn't have to cost so much to say it on a tee. Here are some cheaper alternatives.
