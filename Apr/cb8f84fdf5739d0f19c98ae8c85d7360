Combing her hair is the main event of Alia Nasroya's day - or should we say "mane" event? The 27-year-old from Riga, Latvia, has 90-inch-long locks (roughly 2.3 meters) As such, she spends a hair-raising amount of time doing her 'do: One full hour of combing and a whole day to air dry on the days she washes her tresses, according to Barcroft TV. Oh, and she carries about 10kgs of shampoo, conditioners, and combs when she travels. #superlonghair #longhair #verylonghair #langehaare #cheveux #cabeloslongos #cabelosdivos #supernatural #naturalbeauty #naturalhairstyles #naturalhaircare #hairporn #ponytail #hairbun #brunette #lovehair #самыедлинныеволосы #длинныеволосы #волосы A post shared by Aliia Nasyrova (@aliia_more) on Jan 20, 2017 at 4:07am PST Nasroya has spent the last 20 years trying to get her hair to be as long as her favorite fairy tale character, Rapunzel. #verylonghair #longhair #hairplay #sexiesthair #cheveux #langehaare #superhair #supernatural #superlonghair #hairporn #hairbun #ponytail #pony #hairdiva #cabelosdivos #cabeloslongos #naturalbeauty #beautiful #long_hairstyles A post shared by Aliia Nasyrova (@aliia_more) on Jan 7, 2017 at 7:00am PST Nasroya's husband, Ivan Balaban, is proud of her long locks, but does what he can to stay out of her hair ― literally.

"I always talk to the braid respectfully. Sometimes I ask it to move a bit."
