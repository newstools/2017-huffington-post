ABH poet lippie and Marc Jacobs "fine(wine)" eyeliner 🍷 A post shared by Gina (@ginashkeda) on Mar 4, 2017 at 8:38pm PST Last week, Shkeda shared a glamorous photo from bed that seemed au naturale. Lashed out and Cabo baecay (LOL fuck me I really need to quit that term) ready ☀️🍊🍹 A post shared by Gina (@ginashkeda) on Mar 30, 2017 at 8:55pm PDT One of her fans took to Twitter to gush about how gorgeous the social media star is, wishing she could be as seemingly flawless every morning. Shkeda saw the fan’s tweet and decided to reply with some awesomely candid honesty: She did not wake up like that. In a world where cosmetic procedures may be less and less noticeable, Shkeda thinks it’s necessary to be honest about realistic expectations. “I think women compare themselves too easily on the internet and forget about all the small ways one can alter their appearance in today’s world,” she wrote in an email to The Huffington Post on Monday. “I think it’s important for the every-day woman to remember how the lifestyle of celebrities, bloggers, models, etc. is built around appearance and presentation, otherwise it can take a toll on self-esteem,” she added. “No one is better or worse than anyone else and I believe young girls should be more aware of what they’re seeing before comparing themselves to others.” Yes to all that, Gina. I shook myself with my new contour technique last night .. • A post shared by Gina (@ginashkeda) on Feb 17, 2017 at 2:51pm PST Share this slide:
