Judging by pictures posted on her Instagram account, Pearl Thusi's birthday celebration was a fabulous occasion fit for a glamorous beauty.Held at Sandton's The Codfather the actress' closest friends including DJ Zinhle, Nzinga Qunta and Thandiswa Mazwai came together to celebrate her life.Her fianc&eacute; Robert Marawa was also in the mix and our eyes couldn't help but zoom into both their rings.
