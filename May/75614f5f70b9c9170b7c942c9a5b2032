Analysis The High Court in Tshwane will soon hear the Democratic Alliance's (DA) arguments to compel President Jacob Zuma to explain the decision behind his most recent Cabinet reshuffle. The reshuffle resulted the axing of former finance minister Pravin Gordhan and his deputy, Mcebisi Jonas. The DA filed an urgent application last month at the court to reveal his reasons for the controversial midnight reshuffle in March. The DA wants the changes at Treasury to be set aside. Due to the urgency of the application, the president was required the furnish the court with his reasons for the reshuffle by April 11. This wasn't done. According to local political analysts and academics, Susan Booysen and Daryl Glaser, this is why Zuma should explain his decision: If the DA is successful, and that is a big "if", Zuma being forced to explain his actions may hold him to a higher level of accountability as 2019 approaches. This may put a restraint on further rash decisions made by him. But asking him to shed light on the true reason of the reshuffle may be asking him to explain the inexplicable.
