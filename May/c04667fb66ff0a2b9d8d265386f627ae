The swimsuit seen ‘round the world just got even sexier, thanks to inclusive swimwear brand Swimsuits For All. #SummerIsHere! Let your guard down. 👙☀️#SwimsuitsForAllSummer17 @NikiLovesU, @TeyanaTaylor, @TheAshleyGraham Shop the Lifeguard Swimsuit via link in bio. A post shared by Swimsuits For All (@swimsuitsforall) on May 18, 2017 at 7:46am PDT Ashley Graham, Teyana Taylor and Niki Taylor star in its latest campaign, aptly titled #SummerIsHere. All three women are pictured wearing red lifeguard-inspired one-pieces, reminiscent of the one Pamela Anderson and the “Baywatch” cast made famous in the late ‘80s and early ‘90s. The images, released Thursday, feature the three women, a Jet Ski and some hunky male lifeguards ― basically all the makings of a perfect swimsuit ad, if you ask us. Squad goals. ☀️ 👙 @theashleygraham @nikilovesu @aitormateo @teyanataylor @dustylachowicz #SummerIsHere #SwimsuitsForAllSummer17 A post shared by Swimsuits For All (@swimsuitsforall) on May 18, 2017 at 11:55am PDT The ad even received approval from “Baywatch” reboot star and potential future president Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson. “Teyana & Ashley are always welcome to our #Baywatch squad,” he tweeted, adding, “(of course, I have my own selfish manly reasons). U lady’s look amazing!” Swimsuits For All continues to knock it out of the park when it comes to inclusive advertising and product. Not to mention this looks like it was plain fun to shoot: Badass beach babes. @NikiLovesU @TeyanaTaylor @TheAshleyGraham #SummerIsHere #SwimsuitsForAllSummer17 A post shared by Swimsuits For All (@swimsuitsforall) on May 18, 2017 at 8:05pm PDT What’s more, the swimsuit pictured is sold for $58.50 and, as part of Graham’s ongoing collaboration with the brand, comes in sizes 4 to 24. Excuse us while we daydream about running down the beach in slow motion. Share this slide:
