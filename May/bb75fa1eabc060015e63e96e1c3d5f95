Brad Pitt is the cover star in the summer issue of GQ Style, and the shoot is... something else. Look, he really opens up about his battles with alcoholism ("Don't want to live that way anymore"), and how his split from Angelina Jolie felt like "death". It is a moving encounter -- and the acclaimed actor is honest about his life. The gravity of the exercise is somewhat undermined though, by the absurd photoshoot that accompanies it.
