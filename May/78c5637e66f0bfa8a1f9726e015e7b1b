Speculation was rife on Thursday morning as the Queen's entire household was called to Buckingham Palace The palace quickly quashed rumours about Her Majesty or Prince Philip, after dubious reports circulated claiming that one of them was dead. It was then announced that the Duke of Edinburgh, who is 95, would no longer be carrying out public engagements from autumn 2017. But there were countless tweets suggesting some rather more exciting announcements.
