A memorable photo taken this month has not only highlighted a mother&rsquo;s accomplishments, but her son&rsquo;s love for her.&nbsp;Brittney Brooks graduated with her MBA from the University of Maryland University College on May 13. At lunch after her graduation, she took a now-viral photo with her son, 4-year-old Mason, while holding a sign that read, &ldquo;I did it.&rdquo; Mason also held a sign that acknowledged his mother&rsquo;s hard work. It read, &ldquo;No! Mom, you mastered it.&rdquo;Brooks&rsquo; brother, Xavier Codie Robinson (known as artist Codie Monowi online), shared the Pinterest-inspired photo on Twitter where it has been retweeted more than 5,000 times. Brooks told HuffPost she&rsquo;s glad the photo has had such an &ldquo;inspiring effect&rdquo; on people.&nbsp;&ldquo;I just wanted to take this with my son and hang it at work or home and share with a couple of friends on social media, but I never thought it would be this big,&rdquo; she said.In 2009, Brooks earned her bachelor&rsquo;s degree in communications with honors as well as a concentration in public relations from Bowie State University. She attempted to get her master&rsquo;s in 2011 and later dropped out when she became pregnant and decided she wanted &ldquo;to enjoy the blessing&rdquo; of her first child. She then went back to school in 2015 and never looked back. She credited her family for helping her with her goal.&ldquo;I would not do it without the love and support of my family and most importantly God and my fiance,&rdquo; she told HuffPost. &ldquo;He is amazing and a great dad. Without him I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to do it. He is my biggest supporter along with my son and they push me to do better and go further.&rdquo;Robinson told HuffPost he&rsquo;s also excited about the photo going viral and said he is very proud of his sister&rsquo;s accomplishments.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen her studying in her living room while bouncing on calls, planning her wedding and making sure her son is taken care of,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The greatest part about it was never seeing her knees shake under the pressure.&rdquo;When asked if she had advice for other students pursuing their master&rsquo;s degree, Brooks, who is now looking for jobs in management consulting or event planning, stressed the importance of a solid support system.&ldquo;Some people look at the picture and think I did this on my own and that I am a single mom, but that&rsquo;s far from the truth,&rdquo; she told HuffPost. &ldquo;I had a great support system and even though it was hard and I felt like giving up so many times, I pulled through because I had people depending on me.&rdquo;She also stressed that the kind of support she received can come in many forms.&nbsp;&ldquo;It could be family, friends, coworkers, whoever, but that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going to get you through their words, advice, support and encouragement.&rdquo;The HuffPost Parents newsletter, So You Want To Raise A Feminist,&nbsp;offers the latest stories and news in progressive parenting.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
