We’re “FourFive Seconds” from losing it: Kim Kardashian and Kanye West’s clothing line for children is finally here. The highly anticipated range, which the couple have been teasing for what feels like forever, is sold under the label The Kid’s Supply. It features Calabasas-themed bomber jackets, chokers and sweatsuits, to name a few items, and Kardashian revealed on Twitter that West drew its logo by hand.
