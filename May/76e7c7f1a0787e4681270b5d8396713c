Ashley Graham is a woman of extremes these days: Either she’s wearing nothing at all, or changing four times in one day. At least, that’s what she did for a jam-packed marathon of appearances promoting her book A New Model: What Confidence, Beauty, and Power Really Look Like in New York City Tuesday. Graham did the morning show rounds as well as a book signing in four equally show-stopping looks. Sticking to form-fitting silhouettes and neutral tones, she took the streets by storm, dropping undergarment tips for fans on Instagram along the way. She even wore what appears to be the same corset belt on three of the four looks. We’re not sure that counts as outfit repeating, but we’ll take it. Color us impressed (in a neutral, obviously), and check out her sartorial sweep below.
