While on the presidential campaign trail late in 2015,¬†Donald Trump boasted that he had ‚Äúthe best words.‚Äù¬†In a tweet fired off early Wednesday morning, he may have revealed one of them to the world: Covfefe. While ‚Äúcovfefe‚Äù¬†was likely a typo, the post remained online for at least an hour with no followup or correction, gathering more than 100,000 likes, replies and retweets combined.¬†That caused this new entry into the lexicon to instantly trend: Do not stop using #Covfefe suddenly or you could have unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Ask your doctor how to safely stop using Covfefe. pic.twitter.com/3uOr9EwMHs I like that we all quickly googled covfefe just to make SURE first.
