While on the presidential campaign trail late in 2015, Donald Trump boasted that he had “the best words.” In a tweet fired off early Wednesday morning, he may have revealed one of them to the world: Covfefe. While “covfefe” was likely a typo, the post remained online for at least an hour with no followup or correction, gathering more than 100,000 likes, replies and retweets combined. That caused this new entry into the lexicon to instantly trend: pic.twitter.com/3uOr9EwMHs Nevertheless, she covfefed. Covfefe if you want to live. pic.twitter.com/80m4I4OKsX Don't talk to me until I've had my #covfefe They can take our lives, but they will never take our #covfefe pic.twitter.com/AsmZwCgr6u I'm gonna try and go back to sleep now. Everyone stay #covfefe UPDATE: Trump deleted his original tweet shortly after 6 a.m. on Wednesday, and replaced it with this one: Who can figure out the true meaning of "covfefe" ???  Enjoy! He did not explain what happened with the original message or why it wasn’t changed for more than six hours. Share this slide:
