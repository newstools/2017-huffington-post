Did Brian Molefe resign from Eskom as CEO or was he retrenched? And what happened with unpaid leave?While everyone, including Molefe and Minister of Public Enterprises Lynne Brown, is seemingly unclear on Molefe's hasty in-and-outs from the parastatal, one thing that cannot be argued is that Molefe has had quite the career. Screenshot -- Brown on the appointment of Molefe as acting Eskom CEO Screenshot -- Brown on the permanent appointment of Molefe at EskomA year into his tenure at Eskom, after the parastatal's interim results showed increasing costs and a decline in profits for the first half of 2016, Molefe was implicated in former public protector Thuli Madonsela's State Capture report. It revealed his close relationship with the Gupta family and their company Tegeta Exploration and Resources, which is a supplier of coal to Eskom.
