Celine Dion looked and sounded like an angel complete with massive wings at the Billboard Music Awards on Sunday night as she performed her smash hit &ldquo;My Heart Will Go On&rdquo; from &ldquo;Titanic&rdquo;&nbsp;nearly 20 years after the film&rsquo;s release.&nbsp;Dion, who wore a plunging white gown with huge sleeves, sang the ballad while a montage of scenes from the Oscar-winning movie, released in December 1997, played in the background.&nbsp;&ldquo;This song means a lot to me, and it has played such a huge role in my career,&rdquo; Dion&nbsp;said in a statement when it was announced earlier this month that she would perform the song at the awards. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so grateful to the late James Horner, and to Will Jennings, for writing it and creating the opportunity for me to be part of &lsquo;Titanic,&rsquo;&nbsp;an amazing film whose legacy will continue for generations to come.&rdquo;&nbsp;Share this slide:
