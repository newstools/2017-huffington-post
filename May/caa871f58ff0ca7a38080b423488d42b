Hundreds of people have attended a memorial to celebrate the life of Manchester bomb victim Martyn Hett. Family and friends of the self-confessed Coronation Street superfan - who captured the nation's hearts last year for a touching act of love for his mother - gathered in his hometown of Stockport to share memories about his life. Martyn was among 22 people killed by a suicide bomber at Monday's Ariana Grande concert. "The pain I felt when I found out the news this week completely tore my heart out, but I will not let that pain tear away any of our precious memories we've shared," Russell said.
