Sir Roger Moore, who died this week at the age of 89, achieved fame and fortune with a gun in his hand.The English actor played many roles in his life, but none came close in stature to his time as James Bond a beautiful, talented, dangerous hero of a man who lived life with his signature Walther PPK gun always within sight and on the ready.Between 1973 and 1985, Moore would play the iconic character seven times &nbsp;a number only matched by Sean Connery. But despite his close association with the Bond franchise,&nbsp;Moore actually came to hate guns at a young age, and especially despise the way society glorified men who wielded them as he got older.&ldquo;Of course I do not regret the Bond days,&rdquo; Moore once said, according to BBC.&ldquo;I regret that sadly heroes in general are depicted with guns in their hands, and to tell the truth I have always hated guns and what they represent.&rdquo;In his memoir,&nbsp;My Word Is My Bond, Moore explained that his feelings on firearms were born in childhood. As a young kid, a gun once &ldquo;blew up in [his]&nbsp;hands, which deafened [him]&nbsp;for a few days.&rdquo; Then, as a teenager,&nbsp;a friend shot him in the leg with a BB gun.&nbsp;The fear from those incidents carried over over into adulthood.&nbsp;As Bond, Moore would &ldquo;clench [his] eyes&rdquo;&nbsp;as he squeezed the trigger of a fake gun &ldquo;an old Gary Cooper trick,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;While filming 1974&rsquo;s&nbsp;&ldquo;The Man With the Golden Gun,&rdquo; director Guy Hamilton wanted More to embrace the idea of a more violent Bond.&ldquo;That sort of characterization didn&rsquo;t sit well with me,&rdquo;&nbsp;Moore wrote in his book.&nbsp;&ldquo;I suggested my Bond would have charmed the information out of her by bedding her first. My Bond was a lover and a giggler, but I went along with Guy.&rdquo;When he sat down and watched the last of his seven Bond films 1985&rsquo;s&nbsp;&ldquo;A View to a Kill&rdquo; &nbsp;he found himself disgusted by the level of violence.&nbsp;&ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t Bond,&rdquo; he later told Reuters.&ldquo;I am happy to have done it, but I&rsquo;m sad that it has turned so violent,&rdquo; he said in 2008.&nbsp;Later in his life, Moore became &ldquo;completely opposed to small arms and what they can do to children.&rdquo; He had a hard time even looking at photos of his iconic pose with a Walther PPK gun.&nbsp;Moore received some criticism for his portrayal of Bond as a sillier, funnier man than many of the actors who came before or after him. But Moore said that was more than intentional.&ldquo;I played every role tongue-in-cheek because I don&rsquo;t really believe in that sort of hero,&rdquo; he said in 2001.He added, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like guns.&rdquo;Share this slide:
