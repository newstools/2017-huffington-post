President Donald Trump says he&rsquo;s surprised by the &ldquo;meanness&rdquo; that surrounds him.&nbsp;But in a rare moment of self-awareness, the man who has attacked and belittled rivals often bestowing insulting nicknames such as &ldquo;Lyin&rsquo; Ted&rdquo; Cruz and &ldquo;Cryin&rsquo; Chuck&rdquo; Schumer admits the contentious nature of his White House could be his fault.In an interview with Time magazine, Trump was asked if his White House is too combative. He said:&nbsp;&ldquo;I think it is. It could be my fault. I don&rsquo;t want to necessarily blame but there&rsquo;s a great meanness out there that I&rsquo;m surprised at. I mean I&rsquo;m surprised.&rdquo;Trump also justified his tactics.&nbsp;&ldquo;(T)he only way you survive is to be combative,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll read stories in the New York Times that are so one sided. Hey, I know when I&rsquo;m successful. I know victory, okay.&rdquo;Read the full interview at Time,&nbsp;and for more on the meanness out there, see The New York Times&rsquo; growing list of people, places and things Trump has insulted since announcing his candidacy. &nbsp;
