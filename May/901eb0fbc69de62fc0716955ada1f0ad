President Donald Trump found another opportunity to attack the media during a commencement ceremony at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy on Wednesday. Trump stayed fairly on-script for the first half of the speech, but was quick to praise his administration and lash out at the media while offering advice to the graduates. “Never ever, ever give up. Things will work out just fine,” Trump said. “Look at the way I’ve been treated lately, especially by the media.” Trump argued “no politician in history ... has been treated worse or more unfairly” by the media. Trump then touted his accomplishments, arguing his administration “saved” the Second Amendment and claiming plans for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border are “going along very, very well.” Trump said he was elected to serve “the forgotten men and women of our country.” “The people understand what I’m doing, and that’s the most important thing,” he said. The president closed out his speech with one actual piece of advice for the graduates: “Enjoy your life.” Share this slide:
