With all the dudes named Jimmy in late-night TV, who can keep anyone straight? Emma Watson definitely can't. The actress dropped by "The Tonight Show" on Thursday for her new movie, "The Circle," and she remembered her first time on Jimmy Fallon's show didn't go so well. Fallon was still doing "Late Night with Jimmy Fallon" at the time, and while exchanging pleasantries Watson recalled she told him, "I love that Halloween candy thing that you do." It was followed by silence. After some confusion, Fallon realized, "That's Jimmy Kimmel." Every year Kimmel does a segment where he has parents say they stole their kids Halloween candy. It's pretty hilarious, but it's not Jimmy Fallon. Like she was hit with a Confundus Charm, Watson mixed the two up. (No, Hermione! Noooooo!) "It was the first time we met," said Fallon. "And I died inside," said Watson. The host saw the actress was uncomfortable and let her go out and restart. When she came back, he started the interview by asking her, "Do you watch a lot of late-night television?" At the time, everyone lost it. Like, really lost it. If you watched it and weren't in on the mixup, you'd probably laugh along too, like you were some freshman in high school chuckling at a senior's lame joke you didn't get. But it's high school. You gotta fit in. If you play your cards right, you'll be sitting at the cool table with Regina George and the Plastics in no time! Thanks to our handy-dandy time-turner (called the internet), there's no need for feigned laughter. We can go back and laugh along because now we're all the cool kids in on the joke. If you're cool now, just remember: On Wednesdays, we wear pink. "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon" airs weeknights at 11:35 p.m. ET on NBC. Share this slide:
