Posed wedding photos can certainly be beautiful, but there's something to be said for the raw, genuine emotion that's captured in candid shots. On April 30, photographer James Day was taking wedding pictures for a couple named Adrian and Roslyn, who tied the knot in Bowral, Australia. He was setting them up for some posed sunset photos when he was struck with a better idea. "Just as the light became amazing, I scrapped everything I knew and I walked up to them and said, 'Guys, stop posing. Just enjoy your first sunset together as husband and wife,'" he recalled in a Facebook post that has since gone viral. Day then said to the groom, "I have a question for you, but I want you to tell the answer to Roslyn and not me. Out of the billions of people on the planet, you've chosen to spend the rest of your life with Roslyn. Can you tell her why?" That's when Adrian whispered his answer in Roslyn's ear. Tears began streaming down her face. Day, too, began to cry, even without knowing what Adrian had told her. "It wasn't for me to hear," Day told HuffPost. "I had him whisper it in her ear because it's for her ears only. I like that they were able to share that moment privately â€• well, until it went viral on the internet." "This is what I love to photograph," he added. "Not the overly posed interactions." After the sentimental shot, the newlyweds and their photographer joined together for a group hug. "A photographer that I look up to named Jesh De Rox once said to me that to move others you have to first be moved yourself. I think this is proof that he is right," Day said. Share this slide:
