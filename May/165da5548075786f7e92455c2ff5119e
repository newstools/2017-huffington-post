Melania Trump appeared to want nothing to do with President Donald Trump's hand on Monday. After FLOTUS and POTUS arrived at Ben Gurion International Airport in Lod, near Tel Aviv, Israel, for Day 3 of the administration's first international trip, Trump reached one hand backwards toward his wife â€• but she quickly rebuffed the gesture with a flick of her wrist. At the time, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin "Bibi" Netanyahu was holding hands with wife, Sara, beside the Trumps.

No, Melania didn't slap his hand away. He withdrew the offered hand as she was clearly reaching for it. Let's don't be silly. But we'll let you decide what the moment really meant.
