(Reuters) Three Stellenbosch University students were suspended on Thursday on suspicion of putting up Nazi-inspired posters at campus, at a time of growing tension in race relations.Stellenbosch University said the images, which copied Nazi youth movement posters without their swastika flags, contained "highly offensive references to Nazi propaganda and Neo-Nazism" and were in breach of the university's policies on harassment and discrimination.Read: What's Behind The Violent Protests Gathering Pace In Communities Throughout South AfricaThe posters for an "Anglo-Afrikaner student" event appeared on Tuesday and were taken down on Wednesday.

Black, colored and Asian students make up around a third of the university's population compared to only a few non-whites in 1990. It teaches in English and Afrikaans.Racial tensions have risen in South Africa in recent months. In April, two white farmers were arrested on suspicion of murdering a black youth in a farming community in the North West province.In November, two white men were in court to face charges of assault and kidnapping after a video showed them forcing a wailing black man into a coffin in Mpumalanga province. Their trial is set to start in June.
