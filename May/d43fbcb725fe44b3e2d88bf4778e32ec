Next time you receive a compliment from a guy, we dare you to agree with him. According to activist Feminista Jones, if a woman says "yes, I know" when a man gives her a compliment (such as "you look nice"), it doesn't go down well. In fact, Jones believes agreeing with a compliment in a confident manner is a sure-fire way to piss a lot of men off - and it comes down to the expectation that "women show no self-appreciation". It seems a lot of women agree with her theory, as her recent tweet on the topic received more than 8,000 likes. Piss a man off today: Tell him you agree with his compliment of you. In further tweets, Jones said she has first-hand experience of annoying men through her reaction to compliments. "They even complain when you say 'thanks' with a straight face instead of 'thank you' with frilly giggles and fake blushed," she said. "I've had several men tell me they found 'thanks' an offensive reply to a compliment given to a woman." Jones puts this down to the fact that women are expected to "show no self-appreciation" and are meant to be "overjoyed by someone (a man) saying something positive about them". In response to her thread, other women shared their experiences of facing a backlash after agreeing with a compliment. @FeministaJones I responded "I know" to a compliment once, and the guy got soooooo nasty afterwards @FeministaJones Works every time pic.twitter.com/uUWMAnCtGv @FeministaJones well liking yourself ruins the fetish of innocence apparently pic.twitter.com/uQpkvVclEV @FeministaJones EVERYTIME!
