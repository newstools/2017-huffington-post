President Donald Trump&nbsp;found another opportunity to attack the media during a commencement ceremony at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy on Wednesday.Trump stayed fairly on-script for the first half of the speech, but was quick to praise his administration and lash out at the media while offering advice to the graduates.&ldquo;Never ever, ever give up. Things will work out just fine,&rdquo; Trump said. &ldquo;Look at the way I&rsquo;ve been treated lately, especially by the media.&rdquo;Trump argued &ldquo;no politician in history ... has been treated worse or more unfairly&rdquo; by the media.Trump then touted his accomplishments, arguing his administration &ldquo;saved&rdquo; the Second Amendment and claiming plans for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border are &ldquo;going along very, very well.&rdquo; Trump said he was elected to serve &ldquo;the forgotten men and women of our country.&rdquo;&ldquo;The people understand what I&rsquo;m doing, and that&rsquo;s the most important thing,&rdquo; he said.The president closed out his speech with one actual piece of advice for the graduates: &ldquo;Enjoy your life.&rdquo;Share this slide:
