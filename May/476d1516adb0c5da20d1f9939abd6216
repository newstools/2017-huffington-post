On Mother's Day, we have the opportunity for an annual show of honour and appreciation for mothers – not only your own mother, but also the mother of your children. Being divorced does not relieve you of the responsibility to teach your children the importance of special occasions. Instead, it is also a chance to teach our children to consider the relationships they have with the women who gave birth to them and the roles that their mothers play in their lives. As the father, your ex-spouse (the mother of your children) probably relies on you to initiate celebrations. Here are some valuable tips: Honour your children's mother – let her have a wonderful Mother's Day!
