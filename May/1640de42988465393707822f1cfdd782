Molefe now says he had to return to Eskom asked him to return "b because of a concern about stabilising leadership and to address operational issues that it was facing".According to the Mail &amp; Guardian, in his affidavit, Molefe says: "The correct position is that my original contract of employment did not come to an end," without explaining why his initial departure from Eskom was specifically referred to as a resignation.Brown says she was not informed that Molefe was actually on unpaid leave."I was under the impression that this was a case of unilateral resignation and nothing more."Molefe and Brown's latest explanation was heavily criticised on social media.Can we also note that *even on his lying version* of what happened, Brian Molefe is shameful: Why agree to be an MP if you're on holiday?@mailandguardian What EXACTLY did this statement mean then??? "Leave my employ"...."do so voluntarily"???? @pierredevos @deptoflabour pic.twitter.com/1QohiqHsrZHe took another job. They advertised his old job.
