Ahh, pj's all day, your own private kitchen and the perfect amount of AC. Working from home is basically living the dream, right? Plus, with all that time that you're saving on your commute, you'll finally be able to write your novel/re-organize your closet/get a six-pack. But the truth is that working remotely without going totally stir-crazy (or worse, getting fired) requires organization, discipline and a few clever tricks. Enter these eight working-from-home tips to help you succeed like a boss (while also impressing your boss). CREATE A DEDICATED OFFICE SPACE It's tempting to stay in bed with your laptop all day, but trust us: You'll be much more productive if you have a dedicated work area. Obviously a converted loft with sweeping views would be ideal, but even a kitchen counter will do the trick. (But definitely splurge on an ergonomic office chair. Your back and neck will thank you.)

Not-so-fun fact: You can actually get too much shut-eye, which is linked to a whole host of health problems (obviously getting an extra hour or two on the weekend doesn't count). Keep your body clock in check by sticking to a normal workday schedule as much as possible. Related: How Much Sleep Should You Really Be Getting?

Do yourself a favor and save all and any non-work-related activities for the evening or weekend. Or hey, save it for the kids â€” research from the University of Mississippi shows that children who do chores grow into successful adults. The jury's still out on the benefits of leaving all household tasks to your partner. TAKE BREAKS Step away from your computer screen for some fresh air every couple of hours, even if it's just a quick trip to your local coffee shop. Skirting office politics is nice but don't underestimate the importance of daily human interaction (and no, watching Ellen doesn't count). For a helping hand, check out free apps like Stand Up!, which encourages you to stretch your legs more often, or Focus Keeper, which will schedule in mini brain breaks.

Start each day with a to-do list (try the Ivy Lee Method to maximize efficiency) and schedule a progress meeting with yourself once a month for long-term aims. SNACK SMART Beware the lure of the home fridge. There's nothing wrong with pausing work to grab a bite, but if you wouldn't devour half a pint of ice cream at the office, then don't do it at home.
