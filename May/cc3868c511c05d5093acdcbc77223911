Melania Trump&nbsp;appeared to want nothing to do with President Donald Trump&rsquo;s hand on Monday.After FLOTUS and POTUS arrived at Ben Gurion International Airport in Lod, near Tel Aviv, Israel, for Day 3 of the administration&rsquo;s first international trip, Trump reached one hand backwards toward his wife but she quickly rebuffed the gesture with a flick of her wrist. At the time, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin &ldquo;Bibi&rdquo; Netanyahu was holding hands with wife, Sara, beside the Trumps.A Twitter user captured the swat heard &lsquo;round the world:LOL! Melania in Tel Aviv is as MISERABLE, as Melania in the U.S. Watch her push away the CREEP&#39;s hand. PRICELESS This guy is DISGUSTING! pic.twitter.com/lhR1JdTi1mNaturally, Twitter was in an uproar about it:&nbsp;@raggapegs Damn!!!! Melania pulled her hand away Again pic.twitter.com/eslxE9G100He only tried to hold her hand after he saw Bibi and his wife holding hands. He was like, &quot;Wait, is this how humans act? Melania!&quot; https://t.co/pMLwbbNQj4@pjcobbrocks5 @raggapegs pic.twitter.com/Be9YsJa1NvSome have argued that the swat (or slap, as others are calling it) wasn&rsquo;t a swat at all, but merely a withdrawal.No, Melania didn&#39;t slap his hand away. He withdrew the offered hand as she was clearly reaching for it. Let&#39;s don&#39;t be silly.But we&rsquo;ll let you decide what the moment really meant.H/T&nbsp;GizmodoShare this slide:
