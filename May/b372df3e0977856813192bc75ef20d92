A black feminist festival slated to begin on July 28 in Paris has already been subject to scrutiny and an attempt to be cancelled by the city&rsquo;s mayor.The Nyansapo Festival organized by the Mwasi Collective, an Afro-feminist group&nbsp; &nbsp;aims to be a safe space for black feminists to curate sociopolitical strategies to overcome marginalization and oppression. But the event ruffled feathers, with far-right and anti-racism organizations calling foul after it came out that most of the event&rsquo;s activities would occur in racially exclusive spaces.&nbsp;According to the event&rsquo;s website, 80 percent of the activities at the festival will be reserved for black women; another will be dedicated to all black people, while a third component will be for all women of color. The last segment will be &ldquo;open to all&rdquo; races and genders.&nbsp;TeleSur&nbsp;reports the outcry began when organizations such as the far-right National Front Party and anti-racism groups like The International League Against Racism and Anti-Semitism (LICRA) discovered the festival&rsquo;s intention to only reserve one of its activities for all races. On Friday, LICRA tweeted that &ldquo;Rosa Parks would be turning in her grave,&rdquo; if she knew of the Nyansapo organizers&rsquo; decision to give black women a safe space to share in their experiences with marginalization.&nbsp;Needless to say, when Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo learned that white people would only be encouraged to attend a small percentage of the event&rsquo;s activities, she attempted to halt the festival by calling police officials.&nbsp;A translated&nbsp;tweet from the mayor on Sunday revealed she took issue with the festival being&nbsp;&ldquo;forbidden to whites&rdquo; and that she would even consider prosecuting the event organizers for discrimination.&nbsp;Je condamne avec fermet l&#39;organisation #Paris de cet v nement &quot;interdit aux blancs&quot;. https://t.co/DKJmdPry5vBut, after what she claimed to be a &ldquo;firm&rdquo; discussion with the Mwasi Collective, on Monday, the mayor said a &ldquo;clear solution&rdquo; was reached.&nbsp;Yet,&nbsp;TIME cites social media backlash condemning the mayor&rsquo;s earlier tweets about the festival, as one of the reasons she retracted her stance.&nbsp;Le festival organis dans un lieu public sera ouvert tous. Des ateliers non-mixtes se tiendront ailleurs, dans un cadre strictement priv .Everyone in France had a laugh at her at #Suite moninterventionferme.@MwasiCollectif had always planned black-only part in private only.&ldquo;The festival organized in a public place will be open to all. Non-mixed workshops will be held elsewhere, in a strictly private setting,&rdquo; reads a translated version of one of Hidalgo&rsquo;s tweets on Monday. &nbsp;Bu according to the Mwasi Collective, the set-up didn&rsquo;t change as a result of a conversation with Hidalgo;&nbsp;they&rsquo;d already intended for the &ldquo;non-mixed&rdquo; workshops to take place on private property.&nbsp;&ldquo;After lying about the Afro-feminist festival &lsquo;banning whites,&rsquo; [the] Mayor of Paris lied again, claiming she forced us to change the event,&rdquo; a representative for the Mwasi Collective said in a statement sent to HuffPost. &ldquo;We already planned to hold workshops for black women in a private space [the] mayor falsely [took]&nbsp;credit for our plan.&rdquo;&nbsp;When so-called &quot;solution&quot; was @MwasiCollectif &#39;s plan all along. #suite moninterventionferme #WhiteFeminism pic.twitter.com/G9ET4BTbNXSo, as of now,&nbsp;the Nyansapo Festival will go on as initially planned, and white fragility seemingly remains alive and well in the City of Lights.&nbsp;Share this slide:
