The paper is a valuable Harry Potter prequel written and auctioned off by J.K. Rowling that was stolen from its owner during a burglary in Birmingham, England, three weeks ago. Rowling retweeted the alert, writing, "PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS IF YOU'RE OFFERED IT. Originally auctioned for [English PEN], the owner supported writers' freedoms by bidding for it."

The manuscript was part of a 2008 auction to raise money for literacy causes, selling to an unnamed person for &pound;25,000 (approximately $32,100).We are asking #HarryPotter fans to help share our appeal after a rare Harry Potter prequel by @jk_rowling was stolen https://t.co/NLH79kAoLfFans of Rowling know the author jotted down her initial idea for the series on a napkin, and that she wrote the first installment, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, on a typewriter. In 2007, the author hand-wrote seven copies of her story-within-a-story, The Tales of Beedle and Bard, and one sold for $3 million at Sotheby's. Her penchant for tactile modes of writing has since receded; most her many contributions to the ever-growing Harry Potter universe have been released on her fan site, Pottermore. That makes this handwritten addition to the canon a rare one. Share this slide:
