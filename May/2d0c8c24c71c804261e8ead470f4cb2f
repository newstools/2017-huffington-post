No backyard barbecue is complete without potato salad ― this classic dish has a permanent place on our summertime menu. When potato salad is made right, it’s something pretty special. Its place alongside grilled chicken or burgers balances out the charred flavors of the grill with potato salad’s creamy attributes. The only problem with potato salad is that it’s pretty easy to completely screw it up. If you’re a little heavy-handed with the mayonnaise (or for some people, if you use it at all) or if you don’t use the right kind of potatoes, you can end up with a big bowl of something no one wants to eat. Don’t let that happen to you. Stick with the recipes below. They won’t let you down.
