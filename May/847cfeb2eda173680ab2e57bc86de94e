President Donald Trump's communications director, Mike Dubke, is resigning from the White House, he confirmed to Politico Tuesday. Dubke tendered his resignation May 18, almost three months after taking on the role, Axios first reported. Trump accepted Dubke's offer to stay while on his first overseas trip as president this month. The White House later confirmed Dubke's resignation to HuffPost. The spokesman's last day has not been determined, but could be Tuesday, The Washington Post reported. He plans to return to work at Black Rock group, his communications and public affairs firm, according to Politico. "The reasons for my departure are personal, but it has been my great honor to serve President Trump and this administration," Dubke, 47, wrote in an email to friends, according to Politico. "It has also been my distinct pleasure to work side-by-side, day-by-day with the staff of the communications and press departments. This White House is filled with some of the finest and hardest working men and women in the American Government." Dubke didn't give a reason for his departure but multiple media outlets reported that it was because he was largely isolated from the president's steadfast inner circle. His exit comes amid growing turmoil within the White House. Trump reportedly scaled back the public role of White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer and he's expected to give fewer on-camera briefings after the president's trip abroad. Spicer served as both press secretary and communications director for the White House until Dubke came aboard in March. The veteran GOP strategist rose to national prominence in 2001 after founding Crossroads Media, a Republican media services and advertising firm. This article has been updated throughout.
