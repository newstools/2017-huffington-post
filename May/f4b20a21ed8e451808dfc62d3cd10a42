Can someone give Donald Trump a hand?Not applause. Can someone give him any tiny hand to hold?Given all the attention paid to video clips of Melania Trump swatting away her husband&rsquo;s attempts at hand-holding, it seems that President Trump is losing the popular vote at home, too.&nbsp;Enter: the Pope.The recent viral photo of&nbsp;a very unimpressed-looking Pope Francis&nbsp;standing alongside Trump seemed like just another PR headache for POTUS. Now, Jimmy Kimmel has revealed it&rsquo;s even worse than you thought.Kimmel spent a long segment on Wednesday making fun of Trump&rsquo;s visit with the Pope. At one point he rolled a clip, saying, &ldquo;Professional issues aside, on a personal level meeting the Pope was a big deal for Donald Trump, and we&rsquo;ve seen how things have been going between him and Melania lately, so when Trump reached out, I know he had to be disappointed ...&rdquo;&rdquo;The Pope wouldn&rsquo;t hold his hand, either,&rdquo; said Kimmel. &ldquo;Poor guy. He just wants to be loved. He just wants to be touched. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;It&rsquo;s clearly doctored footage, but wow.&nbsp;You gotta hand it to Kimmel.&nbsp;&ldquo;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&rdquo; airs weeknights at 11:35 p.m. ET on ABC.Share this slide:
