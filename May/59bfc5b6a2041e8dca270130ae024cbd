First lady Melania Trump â€• or whoever is running her account â€• liked a tweet Tuesday that implied a chilly relationship between her and President Donald Trump. Hereâ€™s the tweet from progressive blogger Andy Ostroy that earned a like from the first ladyâ€™s official personal account: Seems the only #Wall @realDonaldTrump's built is the one between him and @FLOTUS #Melania #trump  pic.twitter.com/XiNd2jiLUF The like vanished shortly after it appeared, but it will survive forever in the form of a screenshot: The like was one of just two sheâ€™s bestowed â€• the other being her first tweet. So whatâ€™s the story? Accidental? Rogue staffer? Coded cry for help? Subtle trolling of her husband?
