Ramaphosa said that state capture was "eating the ANC away". #Ramaphosa said State Capture is eating the ANC away. @HuffPostSA #Ramaphosa: "State Capture is the elephant in the room". @HuffPostSA The deputy president furthered that the ruling party's internal battle was being caused mainly as a result of state capture. #Ramaphosa said ANC infighting over power and positions is primarily because of State Capture. @HuffPostSA Last week, Cosatu banned President Jacob Zuma from speaking at any of their future activities -- a move widely accepted as a victory for Cyril Ramaphosa and his camp.  According to labour expert Professor Andries Bezuidenhout, the strong anti-Zuma sentiment expressed by the SACP and Cosatu especially, is a symbolic issue which will have long term ramifications for Zuma's ANC. "Cosatu's voice in the tripartite alliance is still important because of the political muscle they still have as a functioning organisation," Bezuidenhout said. "These are symbolic issues, and a major victory for the Ramaphosa camp." Bezuidenhout questioned the federation's internal unity, saying this will determine its ability to back their preferred candidates at the ANC's national conference in December.
