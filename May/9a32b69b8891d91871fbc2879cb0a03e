Prince Harry hosted worldtraveler and former POTUS Barack Obama at Kensington Palace on Saturday. The two were photographed together wearing nearly identical suit jackets and white collared shirts, a look Obama has perfected post-presidency. Though the two were all smiles in their photo together, Prince Harry and Obama spoke about serious topics, according to the official Kensington Palace Twitter account. "They discussed support for veterans, mental health, conservation, empowering young people and the work of their respective foundations," the tweets said. "@BarackObama also offered his condolences to the victims of the Manchester attack and support for those recovering from injuries." The two have met a few times over the past couple of years and it's clear they enjoy each other's company: Last year, the Obamas collaborated on a cheeky video for Prince Harry's foundation, called the Invictus Games. The queen herself even let out a little trash talking! BOOM. The HuffPost Lifestyle newsletter will make you happier and healthier, one email at a time. Sign up here. Share this slide:
