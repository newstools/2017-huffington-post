"They discussed support for veterans, mental health, conservation, empowering young people and the work of their respective foundations," the tweets said. "@BarackObama also offered his condolences to the victims of the Manchester attack and support for those recovering from injuries." Good to see my friend Prince Harry in London to discuss the work of our foundations & offer condolences to victims of the Manchester attack. https://t.co/7azv4BV2Nt The two have met a few times over the past couple of years and it's clear they enjoy each other's company: Last year, the Obamas collaborated on a cheeky video for Prince Harry's foundation, called the Invictus Games. The queen herself even let out a little trash talking! Unfortunately for you @FLOTUS and @POTUS I wasn't alone when you sent me that video ðŸ˜‰ - H.https://t.co/sjfSQvkzb6 BOOM.
