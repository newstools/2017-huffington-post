The South African Council of Churches (SACC) asked a panel of eminent South Africans, including former judge of the Constitutional Court Yvonne Mokgoro and chairperson of the Independent Electoral Commission Brigalia Bam, to investigate allegations of state capture. This after a similar investigation by Gwede Mantashe, secretary general of the African National Congress (ANC), sank without trace. The SACC investigation informed the probe and subsequent report by Thuli Madonsela, the former public protector. The report was released at the Regina Mundi Church in Soweto on Thursday. The church played an important role during the struggle against apartheid and became a symbolic refuge for those resisting the system.
