A top Harvard constitutional law professor is&nbsp;calling for an impeachment investigation into Donald Trump&nbsp;for obstruction of justice, branding the president&rsquo;s firing of FBI Director James Comey&nbsp;as an &ldquo;obvious effort to interfere with a probe involving national security.&rdquo;To &ldquo;wait for the results of the multiple investigations underway is to risk tying our nation&rsquo;s fate to the whims of an authoritarian leader,&rdquo; Professor Laurence Tribe wrote in an opinion piece in The Washington Post on Saturday. Tribe added that Trump&rsquo;s conduct &ldquo;strongly suggests that he poses a danger to our system of government.&rdquo;After Comey&rsquo;s firing last week, Tribe joined the legal advisory board of Impeach Trump Now, a campaign pushing for an impeachment probe into the president.&nbsp;&ldquo;It is now up to Congress to save the Constitution by initiating impeachment proceedings,&rdquo; Tribe said in a statement Friday when he joined the board.&nbsp;&ldquo;Trump can&rsquo;t say &lsquo;You&rsquo;re fired&rsquo; to the House of Representatives.&rdquo;Tribe wrote in the Post that &ldquo;ample reasons existed to worry about this president, and to ponder the extraordinary remedy of impeachment even before the Comey firing.&rdquo;&nbsp;He cited Trump&rsquo;s apparent &ldquo;brazen defiance&rdquo;&nbsp;of the foreign emoluments clause of the Constitution, which bars a president from receiving foreign funds.But Tribe is particularly troubled by Comey&rsquo;s firing and its aftermath. After the ouster last week, Trump appeared to encourage Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his deputy Rod Rosenstein to provide cover for a decision Trump conceded he had already made and scrambled to work out some consistent &ldquo;story&rdquo; for Comey&rsquo;s firing.Tribe said Trump&rsquo;s actions in firing Comey were &ldquo;vastly more serious&rdquo; than the &ldquo;third-rate burglary&rdquo; that Richard Nixon tried to cover up in Watergate. On Friday, journalist James Fallows wrote in the Atlantic that Trump&rsquo;s scandal &ldquo;looks worse than Watergate.&rdquo;&ldquo;The crucial thing is that the prospect [of impeachment] now be taken seriously, that the machinery of removal be reactivated, and that the need to use it become the focus of political discourse going into 2018,&rdquo; Tribe concluded.
