Last weekend, hip-hop living legend&nbsp;Nicki Minaj made waves when she decided seemingly spontaneously to start making tuition and student payments for straight-A students who reached out to her via Twitter.&nbsp;On Friday, Minaj followed up over Instagram, describing some of the payments she&rsquo;d made for the students&nbsp; at least one of whom started crying, she said. She also said she would go on &ldquo;another impromptu payment spree&rdquo; sometime in the next couple months.Most notably, Minaj announced that she was in the process of launching an &ldquo;official charity for Student Loans/Tuition Payments,&rdquo; meaning kids who are having trouble paying their way through school could soon get some much-needed help.&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be able to officially sign up! I&rsquo;ll keep you posted!&rdquo; she wrote.&nbsp; This makes me so happy. [A few from the other day] I&#39;ll do another impromptu payment spree in a month or 2 but pls know that I&#39;m launching my official charity for Student Loans/Tuition Payments VERY SOON! You&#39;ll be able to officially sign up! I&#39;ll keep you posted!
