Karabo Mokoena died a horrible death, allegedly at the hands of her boyfriend. The 22-year-old's charred remains were found in a shallow grave in Johannesburg's Lyndhurst. She had reportedly been missing since April 28. Just earlier this month, a man was found guilty of the murder and kidnapping of 21-year-old Anelisa Dulaze from Khayelitsha, who went missing on her birthday in 2016. Her body was found a few months later, buried by the man beneath concrete in a neighbour's yard. And these are only recently reported cases. Generally, South African statistics around the abuse of women at the hands of men, especially men they know, are shocking. We have summed up five of these statistics, drawn from studies by the Medical Research Council and Centre for Public Mental Health on intimate partner violence (IPV): Mokoena's suspected killer is expected to appear in court on Friday.
