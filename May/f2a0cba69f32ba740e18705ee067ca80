The beef between actress Pearl Thusi and photographer Austin Malema appears to have come to a beautiful end. The pair has had a couple of upsets over the past year over images and crediting the photographer but based on Thusi's Instagram posts after the South African Music Awards (Samas), all is good between the two. Thusi captioned the image saying she and Malema decided to do things right this time. ❤️📸 @aust_malema & I decided to do things right this time... 😉 .

A post shared by Pearl Thusi (@pearlthusi) on May 28, 2017 at 12:45am PDT  Malema is the photographer who was behind the "credit the photographer" hashtag. His beef with Thusi started last June when the "Quantico" actress posted an image of his on her Instagram and then said she didn't know who took it. Malema hit back saying he tagged her and so she should have known. Read: Not Crediting A Photographer's Work May Cost You Nothing, But They're Paying The Price This year the beef was again revived when Austin subtweeted Thusi and she hit back calling him two-faced. Malema then apologised but got no response at the time. After this weekend, we're happy forgiveness is trending.
