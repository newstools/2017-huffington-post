South Africa woke up to the news that Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane was barred from entering Zambia on Thursday evening. Maimane was in the country to attend the treason trial of Hakainde Hichilema, the detained president of Zambia's largest opposition party. Zambian police and immigration officials were reportedly already waiting for Maimane, who upon landing was ordered to take the next flight to South Africa. While the reasons for his deportation are yet unknown, according to International Relations and Cooperation Department: "When travelling abroad the laws of the foreign country apply to everybody. South Africans are not exempt from the legislation of the host country and will not receive special treatment." According to Zambia's Immigration and Deportation Act: But this does not mean as a prospective deportee you don't have rights. And although it differs from country to country, here are your immediate rights should you find yourself in a situation similar to Maimane's in a foreign country: The Zambian High Commissioner to South Africa Emmanuel Mwaba is expected to be summoned by the international relations department to explain why Maimane was barred from entering the country.
