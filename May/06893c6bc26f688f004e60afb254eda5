British police have identified the Manchester Arena suicide bomber as 22-year-old Salman Abedi. The home of Manchester-born Abedi, who is believed to have three siblings and from a family of Libyan descent, was raided by police earlier today. At least 22 people were killed, many of them children, and 59 others hospitalised, when a lone male detonated an improvised explosive in a crowded foyer. US broadcaster CBS reported that Abedi was known to British authorities prior to the attack. Developments this evening are fast moving as police work to investigate the attack, the worst terrorist atrocity to strike Britain since the 7/7 bombings in 2005.
