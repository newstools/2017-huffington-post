Initial reports said he carried an improvised explosive device near the arena and detonated.&nbsp;&ldquo;We have been treating this as a terrorist incident and we believe that while the attack last night was conducted by one man, the priority is to establish whether he was acting alone or as part of a network,&rdquo; Hopkins stated.&nbsp;Authorities in Manchester said they arrested a 23-year-old man in connection with their investigation.British Prime Minister Theresa May&nbsp;at Tuesday press conference called explosion &ldquo;a callous terror attack&rdquo; and said it was &ldquo;among the worst terrorist incidents we have ever experienced in the United Kingdom.&rdquo;&ldquo;This attack stands out for its appalling, sickening cowardice, deliberately targeting innocent, defenseless children and young people,&rdquo; she said.The blast took place outside the famous concert hall, the largest indoor arena in Europe, near the box office, just after the show ended. Many parents were awaiting their children outside to take them home after the sold-out show . Among those struck in the mayhem was Andy Holey, who was picking up his wife and daughter from the concert. &ldquo;As I was waiting, an explosion went off and it threw me about 30 feet from one set of doors to the other set of doors,&rdquo; Holey told BBC. &ldquo;When I got up I saw bodies lying on the ground. My first thought was to go into the arena to try to find my family.&rdquo; Holey said he &ldquo;looked through some of the bodies to try and find my wife and daughter,&rdquo; and eventually found them unharmed. Elena Semino of Lancaster shared a similar story with The Guardian. Semino and her husband were waiting near the box office to pick up their 17-year-old daughter when the explosion occurred. &ldquo;My husband and I were standing against the wall, luckily, and all of a sudden there was this thing. I can&rsquo;t even describe it,&rdquo; Semino said. &nbsp;&ldquo;There was this heat on my neck, and when I looked up, there were bodies everywhere.&rdquo; Inside the arena, concertgoers scrambled to evacuate amid screaming.
