It all started with a tweet.&nbsp;The Rihanna and Lupita Nyong&rsquo;o movie&nbsp;dreamt up by Twitter users&nbsp;and propelled to viral fame is set to become a reality.&nbsp;Netflix nabbed the rights&nbsp;in &ldquo;a very aggressive bid&rdquo; at the Cannes Film Festival, Entertainment Weekly reported.&nbsp;Back in April,&nbsp;@blaquepink shared an iconic 2014 photo of Rihanna and Nyong&rsquo;o seated together at Paris Fashion Week.&nbsp;A picture for the history books pic.twitter.com/OgxAGZMn4ZUser @1800SADGAL responded that the pair looked like the perfect duo.&nbsp;Rihanna looks like she scams rich white men and lupita is the computer smart best friend that helps plan the scans https://t.co/PhWs1xd3njAnd thus a movie idea was born. Rihanna and Nyong&rsquo;o were game.&nbsp;I&#39;m down if you are @rihanna https://t.co/vwHBWeCbFZI&#39;m in Pit&#39;z https://t.co/Kz0o3lBEmLAva DuVernay will direct and Issa Rae is set to write, according to EW.&nbsp;DuVernay and Rae were also recruited by determined Twitter users.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I really think it shows the power of people wanting to see stories that are women-centered, women of color-centered that are made by women of color,&rdquo; DuVernay told TIME last month. &ldquo;I think it was really interesting that after Rihanna and Lupita were in the picture and the story went viral, it wasn&rsquo;t about who&rsquo;s the male lead or who&rsquo;s the sidekick, it was about who&rsquo;s going to write it? Who&rsquo;s going to direct it?&rdquo;&ldquo;I think that is really interesting about people&rsquo;s interest in who&rsquo;s creating and who&rsquo;s telling the story and especially on Twitter where everyone is telling their own story,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see what happens.&rdquo;Reps for Rae told Vanity Fair that the Twitter users who came up with the idea &ldquo;will be credited and included in some form.&rdquo; &nbsp;Needless to say, everyone is pretty excited.&nbsp;We deserve nice things. https://t.co/VlbKhLNDIvPeople act like Twitter is lame, and that&#39;s fair.
