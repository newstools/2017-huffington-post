No backyard barbecue is complete without potato salad this classic dish has a permanent place on our summertime menu. When potato salad is made right, it&rsquo;s something pretty special. Its place alongside grilled chicken or burgers balances out the charred flavors of the grill with potato salad&rsquo;s creamy attributes.The only problem with potato salad is that it&rsquo;s pretty easy to completely screw it up. If you&rsquo;re a little heavy-handed with the mayonnaise (or for some people, if you use it at all)&nbsp;or if you don&rsquo;t use the right kind of potatoes, you can end up with a big bowl of something no one wants to eat. Don&rsquo;t let that happen to you. Stick with the recipes below. They won&rsquo;t let you down.
