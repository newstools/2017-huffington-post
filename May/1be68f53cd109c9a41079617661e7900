Even the most dedicated "Game of Thrones" fan probably isn't fluent in Dothraki or High Valyrian, the two fictional languages spoken in George R. R. Martin's epic series. But that's about to change. The University of California at Berkeley is offering a summer class in the Dothraki's native tongue. And it's led by Berkeley alum, linguist David J. Peterson, who created both languages for the critically acclaimed HBO show. Titled "The Linguistics of Game of Thrones and the Art of Language Invention," Peterson's class will meet for four days a week during the May 22 - June 30 summer term, according to Berkeley News. The show's seventh season is scheduled to return on July 16. And actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who plays Jaime Lannister on the show, confirmed this week that many of the leaks about the show's upcoming season are real. "Every year, there are huge spoilers online where people find out real stuff and they will post it, and you go, 'Oh my God, they just spoiled the whole season online!' But then, because there's 10,000 other spoilers out there, they're not real. It just gets lost in the shuffle," he told HuffPost. "So, it's all out there by the way ... if you can find it."
