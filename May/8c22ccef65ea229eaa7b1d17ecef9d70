Here’s your reminder that you’re good enough ― even if your anxiety is telling you otherwise. The mental health issue can cause excess worrying and rumination ― and sometimes out of nowhere. That can easily take a toll on your overall outlook, aggravating insecurities and low self-esteem. (Not to mention all the physical symptoms on top of that. Cool, right?) It can be hard to break through the mental throes of chronic worrying, so these comics from Tumblr artist The Latest Kate are here to help. They’re designed to offer some solace to those dealing with mental health issues like anxiety, which affects nearly 18 percent of American adults. Take a look at some of her most recent illustrations below (and check out some of her older comics here). They’re the perfect antidote to the false and negative thoughts anxiety often sparks.
