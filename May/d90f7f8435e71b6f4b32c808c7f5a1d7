For Allure, by Devon Abelman. Feeling rainbow hair fatigue? We have the perfect antidote. The latest hair color trend blowing up Instagram will ease your unicorn-trampled heart and speak to your inner dark goddess. Colorists on Instagram have been dying their clients’s hair a deep gray shade, calling it charcoal hair. The result is everything pastel hair is not. It’s smoky, sultry and isn’t inspired by a Starbucks drink. Celebrities have been embracing the gray hair trend for years now. Earlier this week, Blac Chyna even slipped on a lilac gray wig and totally slayed us. However, this is the first time we’ve spotted this ashy shade. It’s not quite black, and it’s not quite silver, but it also has a hint of blue. Maryland-based colorist Maayan Birnstein tells Allure, “The balance between blue and grey is really key.” And to make the color look its best, “The hair needs to have no orange remaining in it,” she adds. To make sure this happens, Birnstein recommends asking your colorist for a bleach and tone. My hottest and coolest couple, Daniel & Yuki.  Used @guytang_mydentity pink glow with @olaplex on Daniel.  Dark Shadows, 10SS, and charcoal on Yuki.  #kimwasabi #excellenthairsalon #guytangmydentity #guytang_mydentity #mydentity #mydentitycolor #guytangcolor #behindthechair #hottestcouple #couplegoal #pinkhair #silversmoke #gunsmoke #charcoalhair #olaplex A post shared by Kimemily Pham (@kimwasabi) on May 13, 2017 at 10:24am PDT Charcoal 🖤🖇🖤🖇🖤 Grey . . . #charcoalhair #greyhair #ashyhair #redken #redkenshadeseq #06t #highlights #shadowroot #tone #btc #btcpics #modernsalon #bendoregon #salonenvy @salonenvybendor A post shared by Brooklin Keeton (@brooklinsbeautypursuit) on Apr 21, 2017 at 1:57pm PDT Obsessed with this lip combo. @smashboxcosmeticsuk ruby lip liner and @sephora 01 matte liquid 💋 Update: Lens are from @pinkicon_shop twinkle eyes grege grey 👁 #greyhair #charcoalhair A post shared by Suzi Tse (@stylesuzi) on Jan 18, 2017 at 4:27am PST Birnstein uses Schwarzkopf Igora Royal Absolutes Silverwhite for charcoal hair, but many of the colorists on Instagram credit L.A.-based colorist Guy Tang's #mydentity hair dye for helping them achieve the smoldering hue. He literally makes a direct dye called charcoal. Sometimes colorists mix it with the metallic silver dye. We recommend locating a salon near you that stocks the dye if you want to get the look. Also, be sure to show your colorist some of these Instagram posts as reference. You can also scroll through #charcoalhair on Instagram for more inspiration. One thing is for sure, though, you can't get this color out of a box. And on Cat's fourth session going lighter, we took her to a beautiful charcoal grey. Patience and persistence is key!

O'Hara says she "was inspired by the opalescence of rainbow pastels with charcoal tones." If you do end up going for this look, she suggests washing your hair as little as possible. And when you do, be sure to use a cleansing conditioner or sulfate-free shampoo and cold water "for longevity." 💀🌈Charcoal hidden rainbow🌈💀When @maayanbescene tag team @unique_donna we created a charcoal hidden rainbow🌈💀 #pulpriothair #brazilianbondbuilder #b3 #behindthechair #btconeshot_quickie17 #modernsalon #americansalon A post shared by Rockville, MD (@hairbykaseyoh) on May 16, 2017 at 6:42pm PDT More from Allure: The 10 Best Mascaras Under $20 The 9 Prettiest Date-Night Makeup Looks Find the Best Haircut for Your Face Shape 20 Celebrities Who Look Surprisingly Different Without Their Signature Looks 7 Weird Tricks for Looking Great in Photos 10 Celebrity Hairstyles That Make You Look 10 Years Younger
