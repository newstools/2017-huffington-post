If you're like us, drinking Champagne is easy to do. But if you're also like us, you've probably been storing your Champagne all wrong. During a recent taste testing for Moët & Chandon's new sparkling Champagne, Ice Impérial Rosé, winemaker Marie-Christine Osselin told HuffPost an interesting fact about keeping your bubbly in the fridge for too long. "If you're planning to enjoy your bottle of Champagne (or sparkling wine) within 3 to 4 days of the purchase, it is fine to store the bottle in the refrigerator," Osselin said. But only keep it in the fridge for a few days, or else the bubbly will begin to change. "If it sits in the fridge for weeks, the cork can dry out due to no humidity," she said. "As corks dry out, the seal between the bottle and the cork loosen up and the Champagne will oxidize faster, changing its aromas." Instead, Osselin suggests storing all types of sparkling wine (whether it's Champagne, prosecco, cava, etc.) in a cool place, away from light with a consistent temperature, until you are ready to drink it. That could mean a cellar or a wine rack, if you have enough space. When it comes time to pop that bubbly, Osselin also gave few pointers on the best way to chill it (and sip it!). The best way to chill your bottle is to fill an ice bucket with ice and one-third water, allowing the bottle to cool for 15 to 20 minutes, she said. "When serving, you should only fill your glass about one-third of the full way and hold your glass by the stem – otherwise the Champagne can warm too quickly." Cheers!
