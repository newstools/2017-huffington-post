Ashley Graham&nbsp;is a woman of extremes these days: Either she&rsquo;s wearing nothing at all, or changing four times in one day.At least, that&rsquo;s what she did for a jam-packed marathon of appearances promoting her book A New Model:&nbsp;What Confidence, Beauty, and Power Really Look Like &nbsp;in New York City Tuesday. Graham did the morning show rounds as well as a book signing in four equally show-stopping looks.&nbsp;Sticking to form-fitting silhouettes and neutral tones, she took the streets by storm, dropping&nbsp;undergarment tips for fans on Instagram along the way.&nbsp;She even wore what appears to be the same corset belt on three of the four looks. We&rsquo;re not sure that counts as outfit repeating, but we&rsquo;ll take it. Color us impressed (in a neutral, obviously), and check out her sartorial sweep below. &nbsp;
