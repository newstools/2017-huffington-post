Last weekend, hip-hop living legend Nicki Minaj made waves when she decided ― seemingly spontaneously ― to start making tuition and student payments for straight-A students who reached out to her via Twitter. On Friday, Minaj followed up over Instagram, describing some of the payments she’d made for the students ― at least one of whom started crying, she said. She also said she would go on “another impromptu payment spree” sometime in the next couple months. Most notably, Minaj announced that she was in the process of launching an “official charity for Student Loans/Tuition Payments,” meaning kids who are having trouble paying their way through school could soon get some much-needed help. “You’ll be able to officially sign up! I’ll keep you posted!” she wrote. This makes me so happy. [A few from the other day] I'll do another impromptu payment spree in a month or 2 but pls know that I'm launching my official charity for Student Loans/Tuition Payments VERY SOON! You'll be able to officially sign up! I'll keep you posted! 🎀 A post shared by Nicki Minaj (@nickiminaj) on May 12, 2017 at 10:34am PDT Considering the amount of student loan debt in the U.S. has ballooned to over $1 trillion, we’re going to need quite a big charity.
