African National Congress Member of Parliament Dr Makhosi Khoza has been outspoken about the dangers facing the party, including arrogance and complacency amongst the leadership, and a culture of political patronage. The ANC Youth League in eThekwini region called for her to be recalled as an MP, for these comments, which were made in part on the wall of her private Facebook page. This is an edited version of Khoza's response to the ANCYL, which we republish with her permission. - blogs editor. Let me welcome the fact that my personal opinions on my personal Facebook page are getting the attention of the ANC Youth League, eThekwini region. Well done comrades! I understand you want me to be recalled or disciplined. My answer to that is towards the end of this free ANC moral conscience lecture. Next Step: read and debate the ANC Constitution, Rule 4:17. Threats, intimidation, violence and intolerance are strictly forbidden. You are urged to advance your argument. Think ANC, not personalities. Should you wish to invite me to facilitate the session as your senior comrade, you are more than welcome. My 35 years experience from age 12 to 47 years associated with this organisation might just assist in enlightening you about the ANC moral authority. It is free of charge. Herewith are some facts you need to take into account when you debate Rule 4:17 of the ANC Constitution: Any tendency that is anti-progress and amoral is completely unacceptable in my world. I'm a product of this ANC tradition. I wish comrades would enlarge their reflective capacity... it appears to be melting as fast as frost on a beautiful sunny day. So the ANC Youth League eThekwini is calling for my recall because "I want the ANC to survive for another 200 years?" Why do they want the ANC dead? Please help. I'm not getting it! Frankly speaking, I'm a rational person and therefore have zero capacity when it comes to preposterous mental configurations.
