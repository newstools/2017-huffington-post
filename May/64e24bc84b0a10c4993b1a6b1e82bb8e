The SNP&rsquo;s deputy leader Angus Robertson stood in for Nicola Sturgeon.May said she was not attending because she would be &ldquo;thinking about Brexit negotiations&rdquo;.&nbsp; Here are the five times May was attacked for dodging the debate.Tim Farron was straight out of the gates. &ldquo;Where do you think Theresa May is tonight ? Take a look out your window. She might be out there sizing up your house to pay for your social care,&rdquo; he said.The Conservative Party&rsquo;s social care policy has been blamed by some Tory candidates for Labour&rsquo;s surge in the polls. One described the manifesto to HuffPost UK as a &ldquo;clusterfuck&rdquo;.Plaid Cymru&#39;s Leanne Wood sets out her stall as the #BBCDebate begins https://t.co/3UgzdU67uv #GE2017 pic.twitter.com/DedIeIuIoOPlaid Cymru&rsquo;s leader also used her opening statement to mock the prime minister for not taking part in the debate.&ldquo;Theresa May called this election because she&rsquo;s taking you for granted.&nbsp; She won&rsquo;t turn up to these debates, because her campaign of soundbites is falling apart,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo; Unlike Theresa May, I am not afraid to defend my policies, my principles, my values.&rdquo; @theresa_may They respect you more when you show strength. Or show up. pic.twitter.com/mNXXDKL0xdEven the Twitter account for the Netflix series House of Cards was making fun of the prime minister - tweeting directly at Theresa May half an hour into the debate.Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas also had a pop. &ldquo;I think the first rule of leadership is to show up,&rdquo; she said. May, Lucas said, could &ldquo;not even be bothered to come and debate the issues at stake&rdquo;. &nbsp;Tim Farron went for Theresa May again in his closing statement.&nbsp;&ldquo;Amber Rudd is up next,&rdquo; he said. She is not the prime minister. The prime minister is not here tonight. She can&rsquo;t be bothered. So why should you. &ldquo;In fact Bake Off is on BBC Two next. Why not make yourself a brew? You are not worth Theresa May&rsquo;s time, don&rsquo;t give her yours.&rdquo; Rudd, who was assailed from all sides during the 90-minute exchanges, did her best to defend herself.&ldquo;Theresa May may not be here, but I hope to make a good fist of setting out Conservative Party policy,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Part of being a good leader is having as good strong team around you, I am proud to be here representing the prime minister.&rdquo; Theresa May asked why she won&#39;t appear on tonight&#39;s #BBCDebate with other party leaders https://t.co/h9Ad0bpZ7a #GE2017 pic.twitter.com/maDxrKxLB6
