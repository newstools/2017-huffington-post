Economic Freedom Fighters deputy president Floyd Shivambu and Siphesihle Pezi's wedding was the place to be this long weekend, at least according to the party's Commander in Chief Julius Malema's Instagram account. The CIC, as he is fondly referred to, attended his friend and comrade's wedding in Malamulele, Limpopo. Malema posted a picture slideshow asking everyone how their long weekend was -- because his was clearly a jam and a half. How was your long weekend? 😍😘❤️💍🥃🥂🍸😘😍 A post shared by Juliusmalemasello (@julius.malema.sello) on May 1, 2017 at 2:14pm PDT  Shivambu, the deputy president of the EFF, married Pezi in a lovely traditional ceremony. Given Mkhari was the MC and he posted these beautiful pictures of the newly weds.  Shivambu himself shared a black and white image of him and the bride with the caption: "Tintswalo ta Xikwembu! God's grace." Tintswalo ta Xikwembu! God's grace!

People love it every time he sings it and the crowd clearly loved it. Our DP @floyd_shivambu did it, for love and for the revolution 💍 💍🥂🍾 & we sang #Azania for him #LoveAndRevolution A post shared by Mbuyiseni Quintin Ndlozi (@mbuyisenindlozi) on Apr 30, 2017 at 12:38pm PDT  Ndlozi also thought he looked dashing judging by the caption under this picture. Of weddings & aesthetics... 🥂 cheers to the EFF DP A post shared by Mbuyiseni Quintin Ndlozi (@mbuyisenindlozi) on May 1, 2017 at 10:04am PDT  But what had to be the best post from the event is this video of Nlozi, Malema, Dali Mpofu and Godrich Gardee dancing to Xigaza music.  Congratulations to comrades Shivambu and Pezi!
