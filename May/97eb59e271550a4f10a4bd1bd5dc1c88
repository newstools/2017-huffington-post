&lsquo;X Factor&rsquo; bosses have got Mariah Carey in their sights for a judging role, according to reports. Until earlier this week, it was believed that last year&rsquo;s panel would return for the next series, but with that now in doubt, it&rsquo;s being claimed that Simon Cowell is lining up Mariah for a job. A source is quoted as telling the Mirror: &ldquo;Mariah really wants to do it. Nicole is not committing at the moment, although she did meet up with Simon Cowell this week.&rdquo; If Mariah does sign up, it&rsquo;s believed she could be replacing Nicole Scherzinger. Earlier this week, Louis Walsh sparked speculation that the US superstar might not return to the panel, citing the fact she&rsquo;s rumoured to be taking the lead role in a film version of &lsquo;Wicked&rsquo; as the reason why. &ldquo;Nicole might be getting a big movie like &lsquo;Wicked&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If [Nicole doesn&rsquo;t come back] Mel B would be a good idea for the panel.&ldquo;Mel is on the US show with Simon.&rdquo;
