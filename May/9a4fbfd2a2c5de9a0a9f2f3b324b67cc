A greater advantage they have is, should the skill not be fully present, further training and development can be done to ensure alignment to the job requirements."Unlike these business skills, Johannesburg-based HR specialist Tshepo Lephoi explained to HuffPost SA, technical skills are harder to sell because they are normally specialty-based. "Just because you have learnt how to assemble a car does not mean you can assemble a plane. Assembling is the common factor, but what you assemble is technically different," he says.Lephoi suggests looking for jobs in companies in a similar sector.
