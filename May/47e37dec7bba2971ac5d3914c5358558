Get ready to love Michelle Obama just a tiny bit more. The former first lady became an instant meme when she threw some stellar side-eye while welcoming President Donald Trump and Melania Trump to the White House on Inauguration Day. Here's a tiny taste: My favorite moment

As she explained at the American Institute of Architects convention Thursday, the beginning of the inauguration marked the last moments that her teenage daughters, Malia and Sasha, would have in the White House, the home they've lived in for the past eight years. "So that moment of transition, right before the doors opened and we welcomed in the new family, our kids were leaving out the back door in tears, saying goodbye to people," she told the audience in Orlando, Florida, according to Today. "I didn't want to have tears in my eyes because people would swear I was crying because of the new president," Obama added. Though Obama was sad to say goodbye to the White House staff, she also noted that she has no desire to return to Pennsylvania Avenue in 2020. "I wouldn't ask my children to do this again," she said.
