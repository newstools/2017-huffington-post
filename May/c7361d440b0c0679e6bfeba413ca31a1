Nandi Madida and Zakes Bantwini are quite possibly the cutest South African celebrity couple. Madida went up against actress Jessica Nkosi on this week's instalment of Lip Sync Battle Africa. If you didn't catch the episode, you don't know that Nandi, who is a musician herself, lip synced and danced to one of her husband's songs "Clap your hands". It was absolutely perfect. It was so perfect when Bantwini reposted it on Instagram, he said he had married himself. Nailed it 👌🏿 yeb it looks like I married myself 😂 #proud #myno1 #lovelightandmusic2 26 May 2017 #mywife #zakesbantwini2 #Repost @nandi_madida (@get_repost) ・・・ Lipsync battle Champion😎👑.
