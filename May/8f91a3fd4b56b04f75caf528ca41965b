If you haven't seen it yet, Jaden Smith took his hair to the red carpet and of course it's one of the most talked about red carpet looks of the night. Smith told Vogue's André Leon that he brought his hair because his sister Willow, usually his date on the carpet, couldn't make it. Leon's response: "👏🏿👏🏿 This is Avant-garde!"  Of course, if you do something outlandish on the red carpet people are ready with the memes. Some people pointed out that his hair looked like a horse tail. Awwnn Jaden Smith made his own Igbo horsetail for the #metgala with his hair 😅 😂#metgala2017 pic.twitter.com/KKH4MG77yq@buzznigeria  And so the best meme of the day was born -- Jaden Smith was reimagined as an Igbo man.  People said he looked like he was ready for a wedding, with a picture of the inspired look.
