Apologies, Black Entertainment (BET) Awards. You might have just missed out on an opportunity to meet our favourite, Babes Wodumo. She won't be in Los Angeles for the awards ceremony on June 25 because she did not win at the South African Music Awards (Samas). At the awards ceremony held at Sun City on Saturday, Babes was nominated for Best Kwaito Album, Best Female, Newcomer of the Year and the Record of the Year awards. She lost in all the categories. After the ceremony, Babes posted a video slamming the awards, accusing it of being bought.  At the Metro FM Awards in February, Babes stood to walk away with four awards but took nothing home. The Metros were marred by allegations of vote buying, and rapper Riky Rick's microphone reportedly cut out during a speech he gave calling the music industry "trash", reported The Times in February. The artist, whose real name is Bongekile Simelane, previously told the media that her nominations for the Samas did not excite her as she was disappointed by her loss at this year's Metro FM Music Awards held earlier this year in Durban. She said she would not attend any awards show anywhere in the world if she didn't receive a Sama. The Wololo hitmaker was revealed earlier this month as one of the nominees for the BET Awards. She is up for the Best International Act: Africa alongside AKA, Nasty C, and Nigeria's Davido and WizKid at the international awards.
