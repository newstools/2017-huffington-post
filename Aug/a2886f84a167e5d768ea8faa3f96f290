The Cubana lounge in Fourways where deputy minister of higher education and training Mduduzi Manana allegedly beat up Mandisa Duma is calling on women to attend its "special Women's Day treat" on Wednesday. But in response, some women have shown the establishment the middle finger, saying it should first address the incident involving Manana before hosting an event. Read: President Jacob Zuma Says He Is Disturbed By Mduduzi Manana's Alleged Assault Of Mandisa Duma On Sunday night, Manana allegedly attacked Duma following an altercation over a political debate.
In a recorded phone call with Duma's brother, Phesheya Duma, Manana can be heard admitting to slapping her while they were inside the lounge. He is facing charges of assault. The lounge has not issued a statement in response to the incident, and people want to know why. Join us this Wednesday 9 August for a special #womensday treat!
