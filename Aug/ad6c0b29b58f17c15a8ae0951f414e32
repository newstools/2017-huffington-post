As President Donald Trump is on a "working vacation" at his private golf resort in Bedminster, New Jersey, the White House is undergoing a massive $3.4 million renovation project. The improvements to the White House include a new air conditioning and heating system, replacing the current 27-year-old system that's kept past presidents cool and comfortable in the summer heat. Photos also show the South Portico steps getting a much-needed overhaul, with workers replacing carpet as well. Take a look at more photos from the White House renovation project below.
