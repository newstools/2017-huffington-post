Media personality Somizi Mhlongo was in the US to present the red carpet segment of the Video Music Awards over the weekend. While in LA, the Idols SA judge and renowned choreographer kept his 1.3million Instagram followers updated on his moves. His latest post on social media was a video "entry" to South Africa's favourite wedding show, "Our Perfect Wedding" (OPW). He chose American actor, Denzel Washington, and South African singer and songwriter, Candy Tsamandebele, as his "bride and groom" for his audition. Mhlongo captioned the video, which was shot in Hollywood: "So when I heard that Thembisa Mdoda is leaving OPW I thought hmmm I can do this. But on one condition. International weddings. So here's my tape for an international wedding. Candy Tsamandele, congrats. Masambeni." Mdoda announced last week that she would be leaving the show after three successful seasons. A nationwide search has since been launched to find her replacement on the show and auditions start on September 2.
