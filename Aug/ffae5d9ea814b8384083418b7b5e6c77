Presidential frontrunner Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma's North-West campaign was brought to an abrupt halt on Tuesday when union members chased her away from the Marikana massacre site. Dlamini-Zuma and her entourage had to make a quick getaway when a small group of Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU) members blocked them from laying a wreath at the Marikana koppie. The wreath-laying ceremony was part of Dlamini-Zuma's campaign into the North-West, which also saw her visiting members of the royal family in in Bapo ba Mogale. She was accompanied by hundreds of ANC Women's League members and an eight-car security entourage when they entered Marikana. Crowds of her supporters began cheering for her when her vehicle entourage arrived, but she did not get off her vehicle. A group of about 30 AMCU members had barred their way, asking ANCWL members to leave. The situation soon grew tense and Dlamini-Zuma's entire posse hurriedly got back into their vehicles and sped off. Speaking to HuffPost SA, Marikana activist Napoleon Webster said they could not allow Dlamini-Zuma to exploit the tragedy. "She is trying to use our pain to pave her way to the presidency, just like Cyril Ramaphosa did," he said. He said she could have used her position on the African Union to stop mining companies exploiting the workers, but chose not to. "We cannot allow her to come her and use us when it's convenient for her."
