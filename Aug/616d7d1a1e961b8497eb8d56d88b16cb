Ivanka Trump, a White House aide and daughter of President Donald Trump, decided to show off on Twitter the letters she had received from children. The letters all seem to express gratitude to Trump, although it’s not clear what they were thanking her for: Overjoyed by these beautiful letters. Reading them is one of the highlights of my week. 😍 pic.twitter.com/AF5tSMHnB6 Needless to say, Trump’s critics didn’t share her joy. Here is some of the reaction: pic.twitter.com/hZ9tHrz3yL Wow, your dad's drawings look great. I wish your dad would spend more time studying policy and less time writing you all these letters. Here are some other letters for you from your people @realdonaldtrump @POTUS Ivanka pic.twitter.com/4GaRHg8KbC Wow!  How does @realDonaldTrump find the time to write so many letters!? I think maaayyybe this ome is real pic.twitter.com/Y8FKi0XOn6 💲💲👀 this kid nailed it. #Complicit Sarah Huckabees part time job is writing cards to Ivanka https://t.co/5db2OGeU4z Did you get the one from my kids calling you a vacuous, hypocritical narcissist with a treasonous, con man father? pic.twitter.com/W4CRHbqyXG Dollar Signs for Eyeballs=The Trumping Down of America. First Family used to teach children to value respect & compassion over pure greed. 😢 we love a role model pic.twitter.com/0R0QoY4xkY Your dad's handwriting has improved greatly! Whatever staffer made these fake letters to Ivanka Trump, I loved this little touch - was it a commentary on being blinded by greed? pic.twitter.com/qFtUUAGeWo Are they get well cards or something? Or are they encouraging you to take away your fathers phone so he stops tweeting. Why would anybody, especially children, send thank you letters to Ivanka Trump? https://t.co/cqBCpdKKmY What are they thanking you for? Share this slide:
