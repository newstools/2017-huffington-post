Jennifer Lopez knows how to rock a daring dress. She does it almost every other day. On Sunday, the "Ain't Your Mama" singer attended a wedding at Cipriani Wall Street with her boyfriend, Alex Rodriguez. Lopez wore a stunning evening gown from the fashion house Hamel. She paired the $1,310 gown with gold jewelry, a sparkly clutch and some seriously high stilettos. Despite the bling, all the attention was definitely on the dress' stunning neckline and side cutouts. The lovebirds both shared photos from the wedding on Instagram. Lopez captioned her glamorous photo, "Just another Sunday night": A post shared by Jennifer Lopez (@jlo) on Aug 6, 2017 at 6:06pm PDT While Rodriguez wrote "Date night in the city" and added his friends' wedding hashtag.
