IPID boss Robert McBride has been granted R10 000 bail after appearing in court over charges of assaulting his daughter. News24 reported that the Pretoria Magistrate's Court on Wednesday handed down the order and postponed the case to October 2 for further investigation. The State did not oppose bail, saying the only condition was that he should not have any contact with witnesses. McBride, who is the head of the Independent Police Investigative Directorate, was charged with child abuse and assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm after he allegedly punched his daughter repeatedly in the face while the two were travelling in his car. In a statement issued on Saturday, McBride maintained that he was merely admonishing his daughter and that the case was opened by a woman who had asked him unsuccessfully to squash a traffic fine. He explained that he had become concerned about his daughter's school marks and "somewhat rebellious" behaviour, and had admonished her, but never assaulted her.
