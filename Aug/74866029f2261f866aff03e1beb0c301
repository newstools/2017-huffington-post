The grandson of ANC stalwarts Walter and Albertina Sisulu, Shaka Sisulu was this week called before the Randburg Magistrate's Court for allegedly assaulting the mother of his child. According to the Saturday Star, the State claimed he allegedly hit the mother of his child against a door at his Morningside, Sandton home. Sisulu was meant to appear in court the same day that Deputy Higher Education Minister Mduduzi Ma√±ana who was appearing in court for an assault of a woman at Cubana restaurant. According to the report Sisulu made two brief appearances at the court this week, the first time on Monday when he was released on R500 bail. Sisulu confirmed the allegations and his court appearance to paper. "I can confirm that indeed she came to my house for a meeting last Thursday morning. We could not reach an agreement and this clearly upset her. I deny the allegations of any kind of assault and am baffled as to how our disagreement on a maintenance issue suddenly turned into an assault claim," he said.
