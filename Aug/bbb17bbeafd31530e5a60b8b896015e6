President Jacob Zuma has survived his eighth vote of no confidence, defeating an opposition-led motion to have him removed as state president.The ANC in recent days had warned its MPs it would not tolerate deliberate flouting of the party's decision to keep Zuma in office. ANC Chief Whip Jackson Mthembu on Friday said voting to remove the president would be tantamount to "dropping a nuclear bomb on the country", causing deep political and economic uncertainty.The final tally of votes is as follows: Yes: 177 No: 198 Abstain: 9The leader of the official opposition, Mmusi Maimane, earlier on Tuesday urged ANC MPs to "vote with their conscience" given Parliamentary Speaker Baleka Mbete's decision to determine the outcome through a secret ballot.The latest failed vote of no confidence followed many months of lobbying by opposition parties and civil society groups to have the president deposed, which intensified following alleged revelations of state capture contained in the leaked Gupta emails."Today is a historic day. South Africa faces a choice between corruption and a prosperous South Africa. As life is getting hard for our people, it is important that we put South Africans first."
