It's almost D-Day for South Africa's controversial first citizen. President Jacob Zuma on Tuesday will face his eighth vote of no confidence in Parliament following months of calls from opposition parties, civil society groups, and even some ANC MPs for him to step down. Here's what three editors expect will go down on Tuesday:

1. MONDLI MAKHANYA, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, CITY PRESS  "The ANC has been gifted by the opposition and should take advantage."  2. PIETER DU TOIT, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, HUFFPOST SA  "If it's an open ballot, there is simply no way the president will lose his job on Tuesday, and that's if the vote goes ahead."  3. REGGY MOALUSI, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, DAILY SUN/ SUNDAY SUN  "What is different and hopeful this time around is that we have ANC MPs speaking out, saying they will vote with the opposition. That has never been heard of with any sitting president in the last 23 years. It's quite clear there are more voices saying they want him out."
