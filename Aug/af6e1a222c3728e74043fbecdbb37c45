Speaking to HuffPost SA on Monday, Makweya said he could barely sleep after the show. "I slept only for three hours and have been awake for the rest of the time, just living in the moment and taking in all the excitement.

On the backdrop of his success, Dr Tumi wants aspiring gospel artists to away these four lessons: 1. Always remember there's nothing too hard for God. 2. Sometimes people will say no to things you want to pursue but don't listen to them. Just because they could not do it, it doesn't mean you will fail at it. 3. When you make a success of your craft, never change. Remain humble and relatable to people. 4. Be very original. Yes, you can learn from people, but don't imitate others. People will love and listen to you because you are you. Dr Tumi's event, the gathering of worshipers had 20,000 in attendance, filling up the venue to capacity.
