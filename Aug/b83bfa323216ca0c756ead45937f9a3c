From September 2, South Africa's favourite wedding show "Our Perfect Wedding" (OPW) will be on the road searching for a new presenter following the announcement that host Thembisa Mdoda would be leaving the show after three successful seasons. In a statement, Nondumiso Mabece, head of publicity at M-Net local entertainment channels said Mdoda's contract had ended and the show was looking for a fresh new face. This will be the first time it will allow auditions to the general public. "We thank her for her commitment and contribution to the success of OPW. We are looking forward to the exciting journey the show will be taking, opening up the platform for a hidden gem, a new face with untapped talent. This is an opportunity not to be missed," Mabece said. Nomsa Buthelezi will stand in for Mdoda while the search reaches finality. The first stop for the team of judges will be East London at the Premier Hotel Regent next Saturday. On September 9 auditions will be held at the Premier Hotel Marriot Edward in Durban and the Johannesburg auditions will be at The Pyramid on September 16. "The new presenter will need to have a warm personality to match and the ability to connect with the viewers," said Mabece. The fine print? The auditions are divided into three rounds.
For the first one, the potential presenter will be auditioned by the producers and shortlisted for the second round of auditions which will be held by previous presenters of the show as well as Mdoda. Thereafter, two finalists per city will be selected by a panel of judges. They will battle it out for the public vote in the final round. Contestants must be 25-years or older to enter. They should be South African citizens with a valid South African ID. Gates open at 8am and close at 6pm at the audition venues. More details are available on: 010 594 5127.
