Trevor Noah's show "There's a Gupta on My Stoep" came in for rave reviews on social media on Thursday night. But fans were reportedly critical of the fact that the tickets were so expensive, ranging from R450-R1,400, The Times reported on Friday. The host of The Daily Show is in the country for a four-show tour. He will do his last show in Johannesburg on Friday night before heading to Durban for two shows on Sunday. Noah told The Times that South Africans did not want to pay for local talent. "We have to learn to value our own. I wanted to come back to South Africa and perform for as many of my fans as possible. In the time that was allocated to me, and the venues that are available, the Dome is where I could do that. I was in a place where I had to put together a show. A great show. Not just a good show. I want it to look good. I want it to sound good." Noah told The Times how Cassper Nyovest had told him that it was possible to fill up the Dome and still lose money. "It's an extremely expensive venue. It's the cost of doing business," he reportedly said. Fans who attended Thursday night's show clearly thought the price of the tickets was worth it: @Trevornoah show was amazing 🔝🔝🔝🙌🏽what a great night #trevornoahliveinsapic.twitter.com/a3vBwMtLum  @Trevornoah on stage 😂😂😂😂 Joke number 1.
