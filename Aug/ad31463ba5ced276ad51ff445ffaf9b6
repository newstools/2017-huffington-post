Media personalities Pearl Thusi and Zinhle Jiyane have been giving us friendship goals with their public display of love for one another.On Friday, both Thusi and Jiyane, who is known affectionately by her stage name, DJ Zinhle, posted pictures dressed in matching outfits with the #FriendshipFridays.The photos, which had over 100,000 likes altogether, gave us all life -- so much that tweeps have started the #DjZinhlePearlThusiChallenge which is the best thing we've seen all day.My entry for the #djzinhlePearlthusichallenge pic.twitter.com/WZxx32lpbtHere are some of our favourite ones:Well hello mate #Djzinhlepearlthusichallenge pic.twitter.com/nRdd08ZWunYass we are inspired #djzinhlePearlthusichallenge pic.twitter.com/jfbnmsLqSb#DjzinhlePearlThusiChallenge@DJZinhle @PearlThusi pic.twitter.com/aZC9F59Sxa#djzinhlePearlthusichallenge Participating with my cousin ? @Kholza20 pic.twitter.com/vJvcK1J58K#djzinhlePearlthusichallenge The Twin pic.twitter.com/5NHQoRaRk5#djzinhlePearlthusichallenge pic.twitter.com/8M5uAiclRlIf this challenge got you feeling like calling up your bestie, you're not too late.The Parents in Faux Fur Floral Friendship Friday . .
