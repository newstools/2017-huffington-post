Afro-pop sensation Vusi Nongxo known as, Vusi Nova, has stolen the hearts of music fans with his romantic Xhosa ballads for close to a decade. The Port Elizabeth-born musician's love for soul music started at the tender age of 14 when he moved to Johannesburg. He told Youth Village he was always drawn to music. "I can't recall a time when I was never singing! My grandparents were in the church choir so on those merits, music just became something I fell into," he told the online publication in 2015. The late Brenda Fassie, Ringo Madlingozi and his home province, Eastern Cape, were the inspiration for his music. On Friday, the singer was hijacked and kidnapped outside his home in Melville after attending fellow musician Ntando Bangani's album launch on Thursday night. Spokesperson Colonel Lungelo Dlamini said Nova was dropped off in Soweto and managed to get a lift back to Johannesburg. Police have confirmed that an investigation was underway and a case of kidnapping and hijacking has been opened. At Nova's home on Friday, his personal assistant Delphine Klassen told the media he was still in the first phase of shock but he was physically okay. His white Range Rover taken during the incident is yet to be recovered. Here is what else you need to know about the Afro Pop singer...

Speaking to Metro's Fresh Breakfast radio show, the musician shared how people didn't know that Hewana was his brother. The siblings motivate each other, Nova said. The humble Nova claimed he was the "softie" growing up while Hewana was the bully because he was "tough".
