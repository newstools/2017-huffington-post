He knew there would be cravings, but not quite like this. Alexis Ohanian posted a video on Saturday to document his shock over what his fiancé, sports icon Serena Williams, was craving. The pregnant tennis star apparently passed on ice cream and pickles for asparagus.

No chocolate dipped in Nutella or “sheet caking” for her. That’s not to say that women don’t crave for fruits and vegetables during pregnancy, but seriously? Share this slide:
