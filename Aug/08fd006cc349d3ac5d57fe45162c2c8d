Exclusive Books has apologised for grammatical errors in the book, Bonang: From A to B, the brainchild of media personality Bonang Matheba. The book, which was written by Matheba, was published by Black Bird Books and released in July. Twitter users have since called out Matheba for being silent on the matter. Read: Bonang Matheba's Book Launch Was A Royal Celebration. Here It Is In Pictures Leading up to the book launch held in Sandton on August 3, tweeps were already pointing out mistakes on the some of the pages in the book. Poor technical writing skills. Too confused, logical & lethargic. I feel sorry for tautology & the misuse of punctuation marks. #BeingBonang pic.twitter.com/F8LQEEBX35  But in true Bonang style, Matheba did not respond to the outcry. Her publisher, Thabiso Mahlape told TimesLive that she took full responsibility for the errors in the book. "I take full responsibility for what happened. The last thing I want is for black people to be accused of mediocrity and I should do better. It's on me as the publisher. I ought to have done better," Mahlape told the publication. Exclusive Books has asked customers who are unhappy with the book to return it for a full refund. "It is our understanding that the publishers are proceeding with a new edition of the book rectifying the errors," the book stores group said in a statement. But tweeps believe it didn't have to get this far:     But if you're considering taking back the book, watch out for the self-appointed president of the Friends of Bonang movement, Mzokoloko. He will be waiting for you and don't say we did not warn you.  Let's agree to disagree, so much would have been summarised to avoid tautology & punctuality. Unless it was the only way to reach 220 pages. pic.twitter.com/SBOBBY180j  Upon further engagements with customers, Exclusive Books confirmed that receipts will not be needed should people return their copies.
