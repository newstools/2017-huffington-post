Deputy higher education minister Mduduzi Manana will be arrested, police Minister Fikile Mbalula told Eyewitness News on Tuesday. "He's not above the law. He'll be arrested," Mbalula told the broadcaster. Mbalula said he was concerned and could not understand why Manana had not been arrested even after charges of assault were laid. Victim Mandisa Duma broke a rib, busted a knee cap, was bruised on her body and was struggling to walk. She was allegedly assaulted at the Cubana restaurant in Fourways. "If he is guilty, he will be punished", Mbalula said. "He's not yet been arrested and I don't have the luxury to explain why he has not been arrested because there are certain processes that the police and the prosecution are following." Mbalula said that officers were following procedure before an arrest could be made. Manana issued an apology on Monday but social media users, along with the Democratic Alliance and the Economic Freedom Fighters brushed-off his justification and demanded he be removed. Here was his apology: I hope you find this in order. pic.twitter.com/8IIbbD83Q3
