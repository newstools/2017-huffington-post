Fashion stylist and social media influencer Tshepi Vundla had her baby shower this weekend and we are loving the pictures. The mother-to-be took to social media to thank her partner and father of her unborn baby, rapper Tabure Thabo Bogopa Junior, otherwise known as JR. "I couldn't have picked a better partner. Our baby is the luckiest to have you as [a] father. Thank you for throwing me the most amazing baby shower. It is more than I expected. I love you more [than] you'll ever know," Vundla wrote on her post on Instagram. Vundla wore a beautiful dress by Bonolo Mosimege. If the pictures are anything to go by, this may have been one of the most beautiful baby showers we've seen (pictures of). Here are some of the photos giving us all the feels: It's my Baby Shower üíô #TVsBabyShower | üì∏: @urbankreativesa   ‚ù§Ô∏è #TVsBabyShower | üì∏: @urbankreativesa   The Momma and two very interesting aunties. I'm so excited to hold your baby and give him back when he cries #TVsBabyShower  #TVsBabyShower   And if you did not look close enough, you'd be forgiven for thinking this occasion was a wedding.     Congratulations to the beautiful couple and all the best! NOTE: This article previously stated that Vundla's father is Mfundi, the executive producer of Generations and Generations the Legacy.
