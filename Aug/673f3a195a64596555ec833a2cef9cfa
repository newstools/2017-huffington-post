 Award-winning actress Terry Pheto and entrepreneur Mampho Brescia launched an online educational toy store, Let's Learn Toys, on Thursday - and we couldn't be more delighted. The pair, who are BFFs, said they are passionate about making education accessible to all children -- and they saw no better way to achieve this than through the medium of play.

The 36-year-old said she wasn't exposed to a lot of toys when growing up - but has been intentional about giving her nephews and nieces meaningful and educational items. Brescia was raised by a mother who strongly believed in education, and as a mother herself, she wants the same for her child. About the toys Let's Learn Toys are targeted at children between 18-months and 18-years-old. There are more than 2,000 products in the range and the toys are geared towards developing children's motor skills, visual-eye perception and imagination.

The cheapest toy is about R29 and the most expensive is over R1,000. Pheto and Brescia are also working on including indigenous African and South African toys in the range. The toys will also cater to children with learning difficulties and disabilities. Gauteng Education MEC, Panyaza Lesufi commended the pair on the brilliant initiative:  We also couldn't be prouder of Pheto and Brescia's initiative - especially in a country where early childhood development has been identified as being vital to the development of every child.

Trends come and go but we wanted something that will be part of our legacy, and showcase the values and beliefs that we have...Not every child will have the same tool but that doesn't mean they can't achieve stuff," Pheto told IOL.
