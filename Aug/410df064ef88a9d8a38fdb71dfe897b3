One year since the Democratic Alliance took control of four metros in South Africa, the party is beginning its muscles, describing the challenges it faces and the progress it has made in each city. DA Leader Mmusi Maimane, along with his metro mayors Herman Mashaba, Solly Msimanga, Athol Trollip and Patricia De Lille, were speaking at a press conference in Johannesburg on Thursday. "Along with our coalition partners, and other opposition parties, we agreed to put our differences aside and focus on our shared goals. I am pleased to announce that one year on, the national coalition agreement last year still stands," Maimane said. "While coalitions pose their own unique challenges, and are often difficult to manage, they are the future of South Africa and must be embraced." These are some of the accomplishments the DA say they have made in each metro. Johannesburg Tshwane Nelson Mandela Bay Cape Town
