Remember Natasha Stott Despoja? Quick memory prod: She was the leader of the (now almost totally defunct) Australian Democrats party. These days she bobs up here and there in the media and is chair of anti-violence-against-women group Our Watch. Anyway, Natasha is in Kenya right now, and this happened.  A zebra crossing at a zebra crossing. Kenya believe it? By the way, for those who'd like to learn something today, zebras are actually black with white stripes, not white with black stripes. True story.
