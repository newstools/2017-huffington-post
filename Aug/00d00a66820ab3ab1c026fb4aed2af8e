Twitter users have called out media personality and author Bonang Matheba for what they call a rip off following the launch of her app, Bonang By Cell C on Tuesday night. Matheba, who recently partnered with the cellular network provider as its new face, launched the app during an exclusive event at a posh Bryanston venue to much criticism from members of the public. She said the app, which was free to download, would give people a glimpse into her life offering exclusive news and tips. "The first seven days are absolutely free and then after that, you will get exclusive brand new content every single day. Download it and let me know what more or less of my life you want to see," Matheba said at the launch.

So as it turns out, the app is not completely free as people need to pay a subscription fee. Cell C prepaid customers will pay R3 worth of airtime every day. Contract users will pay R50 per month. If you're on any other network, R60 would be the fee you pay per month to get access to the exclusive content that Matheba has promised. People believe that for R60 a month one can get a lot of value elsewhere given the current economic status in the country. R people so desperate to know other people's business?? R60 is a funeral cover for a family  #BonangByCellC R60 nje just to know if Bonang udlile today? Haowa kudlalwa ngathi shem  2lee might be on to something: I'd rather get a burger, I bet #BonangByCellC will be screenshotted, retweeted and memed ... won't miss any sauce😂😂😂   R60 a month just for this?#BonangByCellC pic.twitter.com/W3xwcKHxx8  Bonang over estimates her market influence, she went and had her show on Dstv premium only, now we must follow her for R60 #BonangByCellC pic.twitter.com/5WAj2NRVSh  Asinamali yokudlala thina pic.twitter.com/mVzlcPz1Va  There were also her loyal fans who believe the app has its place in the market despite Matheba being active on social media and having a reality show. She has also recently released a tell-all book which lifts the curtain on her life. #BonangByCellC 😍😍😍 @bonang_m you're amazing pic.twitter.com/YuVcBwlsQy  Levels kwedin🙌🙌😍 #BonangByCellC pic.twitter.com/6QVboM2kXu The app was developed by Upstream Mobile Commerce Limited and is available for download on app stores.
