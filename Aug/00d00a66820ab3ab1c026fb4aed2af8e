Twitter users have called out media personality and author Bonang Matheba for what they call a rip off following the launch of her app, Bonang By Cell C on Tuesday night. Matheba, who recently partnered with the cellular network provider as its new face, launched the app during an exclusive event at a posh Bryanston venue to much criticism from members of the public.

She has also recently released a tell-all book which lifts the curtain on her life.  The app was developed by Upstream Mobile Commerce Limited and is available for download on app stores. To Matheba, good luck with this one:
