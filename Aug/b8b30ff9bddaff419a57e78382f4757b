A full church choir sang prayers to save South Africa from state capture at the launch of the South African Council of Churches (SACC) National Convention of South Africa â€“ a religious gathering to discuss what the SACC describes as 'solutions in the context of a wounded nation.' The year-long program, due to begin at the end of September, will focus on 'desirable standards and values' to prevent corruption of the state, that will, "plug the holes at all levels of government" Bishop Zipho Siwa, SACC President says. The National Convention culminates in a series of public workshops, due to take place at the end of November and a second session in May 2018. An interactive website will also be launched where people can express their views about South African society. At the convention the churches gathered will be calling on South Africans to deal decisively with 'a culture of corruption, greed, and the lack of accountability of the public sector.' At the Johannesburg press conference on Tuesday, where the announcement was made, Siwa discussed, at length about the state of country. Recent events such as the Vote of No Confidence in President Jacob Zuma, the recent cannibalism cases in KZN, and even mayor Athol Trollip's recent calls of Treason in Nelson Mandela Bay were all used to demonstrate the 'broken' state of the country. "We made the mistake of leaving public values to politicians after 1994." Siwa said in his address. "And now we are going back to the experiences of the 1990's political violence." Siwa also said that the SACC is seriously considering going back to old peace accord of 1991, used during apartheid negotiations. The convention will be financed by crowdfunding, along with traditional anti-apartheid church partners for seed support. "Today we say we must ensure that never again will the country surrender its public values to the whims of politicians, regardless of the party." Siwa said.
