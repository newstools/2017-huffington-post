Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, 93, has launched an indirect attack on white South Africans, according to an SABC news clip. Speaking at the national shrine during the burial of the southern African country's two heroes Moudy Muzenda and George Rutanhire over the weekend, Mugabe said he had asked an African National Congress (ANC) minister why the whites still held so much power in South Africa. "I asked one ANC Minister how come the whites have been left with so much power, and he said it was because of your friend Mandela. That was an ANC Minister who was saying that..." Mugabe said.

Mugabe said that Zimbabwean youths lacked the ideological direction that youths of his own time had. "Many of our kids, oh no, they go binging in the company of girls. We want to redirect our youths. They should know that the country was fought for," Mugabe was quoted as saying. This was the first time that the president spoke about his sons, following his wife Grace's alleged assault of a young model Gabriella Engels at a Johannesburg hotel. Grace reportedly used an extension cord to beat Engels while her bodyguards looked on after she allegedly found her (Engels) with Bellarmine Chatunga at a hotel in the leafy suburb of Sandton. Robert Jnr and Bellarmine Chatunga, who were learning in South Africa were known for notoriety and lavish lifestyles. The duo was recently kicked out of an apartment block in the leafy Sandton after they reportedly engaged in "unacceptable behaviour" that left a security officer at the block with a broken leg and arm, prompting Grace to fly to South Africa to organise alternative accommodation for them.
