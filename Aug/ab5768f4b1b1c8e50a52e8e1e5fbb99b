South African YouTube trio, Pap Culture, have tackled Women's Month with a gritty and honest vlog series called Behind These Walls. Each month, the award winning vlogger team made up of Bongeka Masango, Nwabisa Mda and Thembe Mahlaba explore a specific theme which is unpacked in a single video post published every Wednesday. For the month of August, Pap Culture have chosen to focus on different concepts of womanhood through the voices of 10 women featuring artists such as photographer Neo Baepi and food content producer Chenge Magwada. Explaining the motive behind this particular project, the trio said: "We want to shine the light on heros through profiling a variety of womxn. This project is about showcasing womxn as raw and as real as they are. Highlighting their work, connecting with their personal lives and the various of challenges we face as womxn in South Africa/the world." The series aims to empower viewers to indulge in their individuality. This week the YouTubers released Theatre Director, Nwabisa Plaatjie's episode:  The series has been met with much online excitement: I'm living for @papculturesa's #BEHINDTHESEWALLS interviews ❤️ Every single one of them!
