South Africans have expressed relief following the safe return of Vusi Nova following his hijacking and kidnapping on Friday morning outside his home in Melville, Johannesburg. The country woke up to the news that Nova, whose real name is Vusi Nongxo, had been kidnapped during the hijacking. His hijackers stripped him off his clothes before dropping him off in Soweto. His assistant, Delphine Klassen said he although Nova was still in shock, he is physically okay. Social media users took to Twitter to wish the "Thandiwe" hitmaker strength as he recovers at home.    Police are investigating a case of hijacking and kidnapping and are in pursuit of three suspects. Nova's white Range Rover taken during the incident is yet to be recovered.
