 Can you believe that this woman is eight months pregnant? A post shared by MY FITNESS EBOOK AVAIL NOW 👇🏼 (@sarahstage) on Aug 24, 2017 at 3:54pm PDT No jokes. Her name is Sarah Stage, a 33-year-old fitness model based in Los Angeles. Stage, who is pregnant with her second child, has only gained eight kilograms and still spots killer, and dare we say, enviable abs. #31weeks 👶🏻 baby is kicking like crazy !! A post shared by MY FITNESS EBOOK AVAIL NOW 👇🏼 (@sarahstage) on Aug 22, 2017 at 10:31am PDT  This has not come without criticism from her followers - who have accused her of prioritising how she looks, over the health of her child. Medical practitioners advise that women gain a minimum of 11 kilograms during pregnancy. But the model has not taken the criticism lying down, slamming "Instagram medical experts". She wrote on her Instagram page: "While I find some of the comments hilarious, I choose to only listen to my OBGYN and of course I also listen to MY body. If something feels off, I don't do it! I always do what's best for my growing baby and put him first." As I'm nearing #8months I've wanted to share what's been on my mind. Since I've announced my second pregnancy, I've had certain "Instagram medical experts" tell me what I should and shouldn't do.. And while I find some of the comments hilarious, I choose to only listen to my OBGYN and of course I also listen to MY body. If something feels off, I don't do it! I always do what's best for my growing baby and put him first! It's a proven medical fact that continuing exercising while pregnant has many health benefits for you and baby 🤰🏻👶🏻 Clearly, I have greatly reduced the intensity of my workouts and stick to at home home exercises from my Fitness Ebook 2-3x a week. There are also some people who assume that since I am exercising while pregnant, that I'm obsessed with how I "look" but in fact I'm obsessed with maintaining a healthy lifestyle that will give my baby and myself the best possible quality of life 😊 Alternatively, I don't judge anyone who chooses to not be active while pregnant etc. as it's their own life... I'm just sharing my pregnancy journey and appreciate the positive support from most of you ❤️ #thirdtrimester #7monthspregnant #8monthspregnant A post shared by MY FITNESS EBOOK AVAIL NOW 👇🏼 (@sarahstage) on Aug 15, 2017 at 8:18am PD  It's not the first time Stage has made headlines over a relatively small baby bump. In 2015, when she was pregnant with her first child, critics still came for the model, saying her bump was "unhealthily small." However, her baby boy was born healthy, weighing over 3,6 kilograms.
