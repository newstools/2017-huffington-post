In what appears to be a dirty tricks campaign, a "rogue intelligence" report has surfaced which calls for surveillance of deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa's campaign, in which he hopes to become president of the ANC, The Star reported on Monday. The three-page document, which is reportedly poorly-worded, calls for surveillance to establish how Ramaphosa's campaign is funded as well as surveillance of state-owned enterprises, and calls for a R1.5 million budget to complete its aims. The operation is to be "highly confidential" and should be concluded by October. Those targeted include Ramaphosa's political advisor, ANC economic policy head Enoch Godongwana, Behaviour Change Agency founder Pat Govender and former National Prosecuting Authority chief executive Marion Sparg, the publication reported. "Further investigations by the following State Security Agencies, Sars/FIC (Financial Intelligence Centre) and departments must zero in on the campaign kingpin Marion Sparg. Furthermore we request permission to embark on a surveillance operation around Sparg as she will lead us further," the report allegedly states. Godongwana reportedly called the report part of a dirty tricks campaign. Govender reportedly said he had not seen the report and denied "spearheading" Ramaphosa's campaign. Sparg could not be reached for comment. State Security Minister David Mahlobo's spokesperson Brian Dube dismissed the report, saying it "could have been written by anyone".
