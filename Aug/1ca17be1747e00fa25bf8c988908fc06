It's an undisputed fact in South Africa that after the official national anthem, comes Mgarimbe's hit, "Sister Bethina". That's why when Mgarimbe, real name Nkosinathi Mfeka, took to Twitter to express his interest to open for American hip hop group, Migos, during their concert in Durban, South Africans felt he should have been an obvious choice. On Wednesday, he asked concert organisers, Mabala Noise, how many Retweets (RTs) he would need for them to add him to the line-up of the artists opening up for the multi award winning trio in the Durban leg of their South African tour, come October. Read: Raindrops, Drop Tops: Migos Are Coming To South Africa Mabala wasted no time with that positive response challenging him to collect some 2,000 RTs before they can seal the deal. 2000 Retweets and we on @mgarimbe_10 !!!!  On Thursday, the 34-year-old had over 5,000 RTs to his post and announced that he'd be performing the Sister Bhethina at the concert. But people don't believe Mgarimbe should have to work that hard for the gig and want the record to be set straight to avoid confusion on Migos' side.    true... coz Migos will sh@t their pants after seeing ppl lose their morals ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚to Sister Bethina  The record label and entertainment company is yet to confirm the deal since Mgarimbe exceeded their 2,000 RTs target and tweeps are waiting.  And there you have it fam,  Migos will be in South Africa for tonight under the banner, #MigosCultureTour. On October 20, the group takes to the stage at the Durban ICC and on October 21 will be Joburg's turn at the Ticketpro Dome. Tickets and more details are available here. But if you have forgotten what the song sounds like, this should jog your memory.
