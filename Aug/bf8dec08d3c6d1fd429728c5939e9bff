The Gupta family accused Gordhan of using his office to start a war with them. The Gupta family contended that Gordhan tried to use a court order to air out the family's dirty laundry while protecting the banks. The application was lodged in October 2016. Nedbank, Barclays Africa Group Limited, Standard Bank and First Rand Bank cut ties with the Gupta's Oakbay group of companies last year. Gordhan's legal team submitted in court that it would be wrong for him or any other Cabinet member to be involved in a matter between a private bank and its customers, EWN reported.
