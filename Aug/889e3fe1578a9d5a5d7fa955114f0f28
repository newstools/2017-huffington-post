Speaker of Parliament, Baleka Mbete has revealed the pressure she has been under in deciding whether to allow a secret ballot in the vote on Tuesday's motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma.The Sunday Times reported that Mbete was still agonising over what to do and was quoted as saying: "You don't wish to be me, it's a difficult place to be. It's what Sotho people call 'kgomo ya moshate' [damned if you do, damned if you don't]."According to the report Mbete was consulting her senior counsel in the matter."I am still applying my mind. It's not the best place to be in ... That's all I'm prepared to say to you and on Monday I'll have to finalise this exercise," she said.Zuma has survived numerous accounts to have him removed from office and Mbete's loyalty to the party will be tested and she denied that she is using delaying tactics to avoid a possible court challenge by opposition parties.She is expected to announce her decision tomorrow.
