Actress and media personality Enhle Mbali Maphumulo attended the inaugural DStv Mzansi Viewers' Choice Awards looking like a million bucks in the white dress she wore at her wedding reception back in January. Maphumulo also took to the stage to receive the award for favourite DJ on behalf of her husband, Black Coffee, whose real name is Nkosinathi Maphumulo. She looked regal and oozed class. Her fans also loved the look, but others experienced flashbacks to eight months ago. I Though I Saw This Dress From Some Wedding.. #DStvMVCA ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ pic.twitter.com/30k23AbfOe  But it wasn't too long before both Maphumulo herself and Black Coffee responded.   While we don't see why Maphumulo should have to explain her choice of outfit to anyone, we love how most Twitter users responded.   This will liberate even people who can't afford not to wear the same dress twice. Siyabonga Mbali no Coffee   Thank you for showing us this dress again yoh its so beautiful.. and people say eish when will I wear my wedding dress again? This is when pic.twitter.com/SWpq34T7p5  Awards shows are known for over the top dresses that aren't always realistic. If we looked as gorgeous as she did (both times), best believe we'd be in that dress to every Sunday service we attend. Thank you, Mrs Maphumulo for reminding us to be real. We loved seeing you that dress again and we are hopeful that more people will realise that what you wear is not anyone's business even if it's on the red carpet.
