On Thursday night, Taylor Swift’s new single, “Look What You Made Me Do,” slithered its way onto various streaming services. The lead single off the pop star’s upcoming sixth studio album, entitled “Reputation,” includes thinly veiled references to Kanye West and Kim Kardashian, mentions of an Arya Stark-ish type of list, and a great moment where Swift stops singing and speaks the words: “I’m sorry, but the old Taylor can’t come to the phone right now. Why? Oh … ’Cause she’s dead.” That’s right. The sweet, squad-loving (albeit occasional cake-stabbing) Taylor of yesterday is gone and the new Taylor who’s risen from the dead, honey, is edgy. And dangerous. And about as dark as a kitten wearing a spiked collar from Hot Topic who might have, maybe, swiped at a bird once. Twitter, of course, has a lot of feelings about the new Taylor and her even newer track, and shared them online. Here are the funniest responses: Red: I lost myself 1989: I found myself Reputation: I'm dead 2010 taylor: who you are is not what you did, you're still an innocent2017 taylor: I AM DEAD NOW AND SO ARE YOU BECAUSE I WILL KILL YOU Me before and after listening to #LookWhatYouMadeMeDo: pic.twitter.com/AbJWJVy2yC #LookWhatYouMadeMeDo "I've got a list of names and yours is in red underlined"LOOK OUT REGINA TAYLOR'S COMING FOR YOU pic.twitter.com/gYjLYmYEJF Is...is Taylor Swift Santa Claus? pic.twitter.com/hj6ICCEiJc What I predicted about other songs in album like #LookWhatYouMadeMeDo : pic.twitter.com/w6XQo6MTrP Me listening to #LookWhatYouMadeMeDo thinking of everyone who has ever wronged me pic.twitter.com/tkudY7vy4V *burns all of my red lipstick* pic.twitter.com/L2m0YDgPVu Taylor Swift just got to the Dark Willow episodes of buffy Yasssss Taylor Swift just dropped a fire Lorde song 🔥🔥🔥 Taylor Swift's catty clapback single is somewhat undermined by sounding EXACTLY like "Too Sexy for My Shirt" I feel like @taylorswift13 is going thru the same things that robin sparkles did when she became robin daggers #LookWhatYouMadeMeDo pic.twitter.com/Fs95W3XHob me: only deep, meaningful lyrics get meTaylor Swift: Ooh, look what u made me do.
