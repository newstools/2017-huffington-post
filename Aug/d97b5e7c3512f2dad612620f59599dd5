The 36-year-old man whose gun Vusi Mdluli used to kill his wife, Kate Chiloane, and commit suicide is appearing in the Bushbuckridge Magistrate's Court on charges of negligent handling of a firearm. On Tuesday, spokesperson for police in Mpumalanga Brigadier Leonard Hlathi told HuffPost SA that the man was arrested after investigations linked him to the firearm which was found by Mduli's side after he'd committed suicide.

Our investigations continued and we arrested that person shortly after that. I must also warn people to be careful when handling firearms -- it's not something you can just borrow someone. It is your responsibility to make sure you keep it in a safe place at all times," Hlathi added. He said results from the man's court appearance would only be available at the close of business on Tuesday as proceedings are underway. Mdluli gunned down Chiloane, a school teacher at the Sediba-Sa-Thuto primary school on Monday morning in full view of her Grade 2 learners. He later committed suicide at home. Police have since opened murder and inquest dockets.
