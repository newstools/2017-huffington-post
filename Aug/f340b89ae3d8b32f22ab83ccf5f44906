We thought it would have faded by now, but nope, #FindLovewithKholi on Twitter seems to be gaining momentum. How it works is you post a selfie with a brief description of who you are, the type of partner you're looking for and then use the hashtag. Then, hopefully, it gets sorted in the DMs. It's not surprising that something like this would hit it off with tweeps -- because, honestly, who doesn't want some loving? And if people can successfully use Tinder and OkCupid, or go to Date My Family, then surely there's hope with this hashtag. But with matters of the heart, Twitter remains truly ungovernable. Here are our absolute faves from the trending hashtag:  Who can forget this gentle brother who was caught out by his lady?  He he he, the persistent issue of land.  We want what we want and we're clear on it. #FindLoveWithKholi Im looking for a guy engizom' user nje ge app. Must be between 37-42years of age, be on a higher tax bracket than me üôÉ pic.twitter.com/qSTo65kZOy  Ho thata.
