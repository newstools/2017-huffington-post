It would seem fans have forgiven Bontle Modiselle and her boyfriend, Ricardo Moloi for leading them to believe they'd got engaged and married. The couple sparked engagement rumours in July when Modiselle posted a snap of her Moloi, known popularly by his stage name, Priddy Ugly, on one knee proposing to her. As it turned out, they were starring in the music video of the song, "I do" by La Sauce, featuring Amanda Black. At the weekend, Ambitiouz Entertainment under which LaSauce, real name Sindisiwe Magoso and Amanda Antony are signed, announced that the video had reached a million views mark on Youtube. We would like to thank you for such amazing support and love 🙏🏾#IdoVideo reached a million views in 13days... thank you family pic.twitter.com/yKSVyYbrc0  The record label thanked fans and for showing support and watching the music video. Following the release of the video, LaSauce took to social media to thank the couple for their participation. She said she could not have picked a better couple to star in the video of her song, which celebrates love and we could not agree more. #IDO by @lasaucesa ft @amandablacksa Stars @priddy_ugly x @bontle.modiselle hits A Milli💣🔥🔥 Thank you Mzansi for making it real❤️ Shoutout to the A-Team🙏🏽😱  Given the chance, we would have also picked this couple for the video simply because of how great they look together -- the real chemistry between them makes all the acting look so magical. In an Instagram post, Modiselle said she was happy and proud to have taken part in the music video which takes people on the stages and journey of young love. More than genuinely loving the song, we loved being the representation of what it advocates - a young, black love that have the intention of solidifying their lifetime commitment to each other, represented here as marriage. We understood the implications of deciding on how to best go about making the greatest impact in encouraging a conversation of love, something that doesn't make the headlines, and so we were bold in our approach. Everything that we posted were all images leading up to the video, we just hadn't announced that yet. Those who know us personally, who were all notified and prepared prior to the video dropping, know that we are not the type of folk to let out the details of our personal lives like that. People know of us being together but do not know anything beyond that, particularly the state of our relationship. That privacy remains true for our engagement and marriage which will remain our private matter. Those who need to know, will know. Apologies to those who feel disappointed right now but we hope you find solace in us being together and happy. Major love to those who laughed it off and found it brilliant. Thank you to those who give continued support. Reaction and interpretation is open to anything. Everyone is open to decide how they feel about it. We, however, are happy and proud of it. It's huge. It's beautiful. It's really all love. ✊❤ Watch @lasaucesa ft @amandablacksa - 'I Do' here: https://youtu.be/ISNm4knGl-k 🙏  When their actual wedding day eventually comes, we know for sure that the duo makes a perfect bride and groom. So we will wait.
