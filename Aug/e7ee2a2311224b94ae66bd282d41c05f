If you can&rsquo;t go a day without your morning coffee on holiday, we&rsquo;ve got bad news for you.Instead of providing you with a taste of home, the kettle in your hotel room could be leaving you with a mouthful of someone else&rsquo;s dirty underwear.That&rsquo;s right, cleaning your grubby pants in hotel kettles is a thing, apparently.The abominable habit shot onto our radars after a Twitter user asked others whether they had tried it. The man said he&rsquo;d heard about the practice from a friend.Real question: does anyone I know clean their underwear in a kettle when travelling?&nbsp;Understandably, people on Twitter seemed to be as grossed out as us.What type of sick world do we live in where people clean their underwear in a kettle? It&#39;s official. Boiling water is no longer safe. pic.twitter.com/qtTxrm80FiWelp, remind me to never use a hotel kettle ever again.In case there was any doubt,&nbsp;Dr Heather Hendrickson, a senior lecturer in Molecular Biosciences at Massey University in Aukland, has confirmed that boiling your underwear in a kettle is a bad idea.&nbsp;Speaking to Gizmodo, she explained that while boiling kills most germs, it doesn&rsquo;t kill all microorganisms. This is because some bacteria form spores - such as clostidium botulinum spores - that are are resistant to heat below 120 degrees celsius.&nbsp;&ldquo;These don&rsquo;t cause sickness if they are consumed, but their presence in certain environments can encourage them to produce a toxin that can be deadly,&rdquo; she said. &nbsp;Thankfully, boiling water contaminated with bacterial pathogens is likely to reduce any nastiness to low levels that are unlikely to seriously damage health.But Dr Hendrickson still maintained that using a hotel kettle is&nbsp;&ldquo;super, super, super, super gross&rdquo;.&nbsp;&ldquo;Who knows how long that water, with nutrients that have been introduced and then sterilised, sits around in the kettle before someone else uses it?&rdquo; she said.Well, that&rsquo;s ruined hotel tea for all of us.&nbsp;
