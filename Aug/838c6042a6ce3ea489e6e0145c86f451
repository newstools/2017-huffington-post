National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete has warned that disunity will cost the ANC dearly in 2019, The Sowetan reported on Friday. Mbete was on the campaign trail this week, visiting Orange Farm near Johannesburg on Thursday where about 200 people reportedly waited for four hours to hear her speak. "I don't think there is anyone here that would want to see us under Mmusi Maimane, 2019 is not going to be smooth sailing," she reportedly told supporters. Mbete said the ANC needed to unite as a lack of unity would cost the party in the election. "Those who have left should be brought back because 2019 is not going to be easy, comrades. If we continue with this disunity and not build this movement, it means we are going to lose in 2019. What will Oliver Tambo say? What will Mandela say?" Mbete told the crowd in Xhosa. One of the organisers of Mbete's event, Orange Farm youth leader Ntando Dlamini told The Sowetan that it was a campaign event. "As she's standing for president in the much-awaited December ANC elective conference, we have invited her to come here and tell us what she has in store for us, especially the youth and women."
