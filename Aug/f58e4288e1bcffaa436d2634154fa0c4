Happy Women's Day to all you beautiful mbokodos out there. We hope you have a wonderful day and are celebrated in your circles. We are crushing so hard on the following boss ladies who are doing the damn things in the business of entertainment. We see you and cannot wait to grow up and be just like you: 1. Connie Ferguson: She came from being known as just an actress to owning one of the country's most popular production companies, Ferguson Films.
We love how she remains graceful in all her glory and success. Read: Here's 4 Reasons Why We Cannot Get Over Connie And Shona Fergusons' Greatness #silverstreaksonfleek!😂 #becausewisdom😉 ❤😘   2.
