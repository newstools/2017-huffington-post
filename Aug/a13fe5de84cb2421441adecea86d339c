The Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein on Friday overturned an earlier decision granting Chris Hani's killer, Janusz Walus, parole. Walus, a Polish immigrant and white supremacist, has spent 24 years in jail for assassinating the SACP leader and Mandela's likely successor in April 1993 together with Clive Derby-Lewis, who died of cancer in November last year. Justice Minister Michael Masutha, who launched an appeal against the North Gauteng High Court's decision to release Walus on parole, was given 90 days by the SCA to to reconsider whether he should be released. "The matter is remitted to the appellant [Masutha] for his reconsideration and decision within 90 calendar days of this order," the SCA said. The Justice Ministry welcomed the decision, according to reports. The Justice Ministry has welcomed the judgement by the SCA overturning a ruling that #JanuszWalus be released on parole.  Following the High Court's ruling in March to release Walus on parole, groups and people including Hani's widow Mpho and the Youth Communist League of SA slammed the decision, saying Walus does not deserve to be back in society.
