Babes Wodumo may have just secured her spot on this year's nomination list for the SABC Summer Song of the Year Competition following the release of her new track, "Gandaganda". Real name Bongekile Simelane, Babes released the song on iTunes on Wednesday and it features her beau and West Ink Records boss, Mandla Mampintsha Maphumulo as well as her label mate, Madanon. In the days leading up to the release, Babes had the country looking suspiciously at the folks on Durban's South Beach after she announced that a USB with the unmastered version of the song was missing and that the song was heard playing around that area.  It turned out the plea was but a PR stunt to create the hype for the new single.
