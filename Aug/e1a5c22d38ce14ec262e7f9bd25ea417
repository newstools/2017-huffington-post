South African celebrities certainly know how to flaunt their style, and with the money they rake in they must surely drive in style. Musicians such as Cassper Nyovest, real name Refiloe Phoolo, have never been afraid to spend lavishly to get the cars they want, even if it means two of the same. Celebrities flashing their expensive cars are nothing new in South Africa. Like AKA, real name Kiernan Forbes, who after signing a reported seven-figure deal with Reebok, decided to spoil himself with the addition of a new BMW i8. Other household names such as Bonang Matheba and Somizi Mhlongo are also the "whip" kings and queens. Here are some of the cars that our top celebrities drive. AKA: BMW Rapper AKA decided to spoil himself on the weekend when he bought the BMW i8 and added another beamer to his car collection. He now has a BMW X6 and i8. Be Careful What You Wish For. 🔥 A post shared by AKA (@akaworldwide) on Aug 26, 2017 at 8:02am PDT  Cassper Nyovest: Bentley Cassper Nyovest has not one, but two Bentleys. He is never shy about flaunting his richness, and in his hit single "Tito Mboweni" he says "Got a Bentley and a Bentley, Major League with the whips". He is basically comparing the Major League twins to his Bentley twins and is the undisputed "whip king'. En route to my 26th birthday party in Maftown with my twins!!! Dreams come true bro!!! God is really good!!! #BentleyBoys A post shared by Refiloe Phoolo 🇿🇦 (@casspernyovest) on Dec 17, 2016 at 8:45am PST  Somizi Mhlongo: Mercedes & BMW Somizi does it big. After he bought the BMW i8 he followed that up with the purchase of a Mercedes. Talk about options, woo-shem. #mma2017 #metrofmawards #umsindo🔥🔥🔥🔨🔨🔨✔️✔️ A post shared by Somizi (@somizi) on Feb 22, 2017 at 5:39am PST  Road trip. Solo. Once in a while the best conversations are with thy self. A post shared by Somizi (@somizi) on May 19, 2017 at 7:50am PDT  Bonang: Mercedes Queen B* has a book, an app and a G-Wagon Mercedes to her name. The South African celebrity copped herself a G-Wagon before it was even cool.   Euphonik: Rolls Royce Wraith DJ Euphonik, an international star who does most of his tours overseas, drive in a beautiful red and silver Bentley. And no, it is not Cassper's car. What do people actually mean when they say "Painting the town red"? I've never really understood and I doubt they do too 😎. #RedWraith #CrownManor #KeepUp A post shared by Euphonik (@euphonik) on Aug 26, 2015 at 10:51am PDT
