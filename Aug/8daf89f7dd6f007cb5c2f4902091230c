African National Congress treasurer general Zweli Mkhize believes Radical Economic Transformation is a key element in creating equal opportunities for women in South Africa. Mkhize said RET is about creating growth in the economy for everyone to participate in. "We must ensure gender participation across all sectors in the economy," Mkhize said. He was speaking alongside small business development minister Lindiwe Zulu at the party's Progressive Business Forum luncheon for women in business. "Women themselves must already know they are equal to all and deserve to participate in every facet of society... As the ANC, we are talking strongly on RET. For that to succeed, you need to be ready to challenge the system," Mkhize said. "Women in South Africa have proven beyond doubt that they are just as capable, if not better, in certain circumstances." Zulu also pushed the RET rhetoric, saying that women now need to focus on the transformation of the country's economy. "The generation of 1976 delivered. Your 1976 is going to be you now focusing on Radical Economic Transformation," she said. "Nobody in South Africa can say they do not have women pioneers that they can look up to. Democracy opened up opportunity for women who had been left out in the past."
