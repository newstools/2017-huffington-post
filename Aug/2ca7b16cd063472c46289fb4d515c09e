Minister of Police, Fikile Mbalula, spoke out against violence against vulnerable people like women and gay people and said Minister Mduduzi Manana would face the full might of the law. Mbalula said deputy minister of higher education and training, Mduduzi Manana, accused of hitting a woman in a nightclub, would not receive special treatment even though he was not actually arrested before his court appearance on Thursday. "The minister must be held accountable... He will not be treated with kid gloves," said Mbalula. He continued: "I saw a woman assaulted by a group of men who apparently had a problem with something she said... I saw an exchange of punches at a beer hall well after hours." He said that Manana was not arrested as the case was "not an emergency" -- an example of this would be a man caught in the act of beating his wife -- and there was no flight risk as Manana is a known individual. Even with the video evidence published on social media and Manana apparently admitting to the charge in his apology, Mbalula insisted there was never a reason to arrest him. Mbalula said he wanted to make it easier for women and all vulnerable groups to report crimes and it would be launching a new initiative to achieve this on Friday. A man who slapped a woman today could become a "lady killer" tomorrow and someone who touched a woman today could become a "rapist" tomorrow. Our police stations must become the front line against gender abuse, said Mbalula. Manana's bail has been set at R5,000
