Celine Dion is the smoothest single lady out there. The singer and style goddess was answering questions at the launch of her new bag and accessories collection on Wednesday when a reporter asked about her relationship status following the death of her husband. "I wanted to ask you about your personal life," the reporter said. "It's a whole new world for you, you're a single woman. How is life?" Without skipping a beat, Dion gave him an incredulous look. "Are you asking me out?" she responded. The crowd applauded, and the reporter couldn't help but laugh. Dion then riffed Rihanna's "Diamonds," just for good measure. But it's her body language as she answers in the video above that really got us. Dion had just finished delivering powerful remarks about her late husband, who died of cancer last year. We admire her ability to switch gears so quickly. All hail the queen. Share this slide:
