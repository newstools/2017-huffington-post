He reportedly told her brother he did this because she said he was gay.Manana will be arrested, Police Minister Fikile Mbalula told Eyewitness News on Tuesday. However, he was not arrested before his court appearance."He's not above the law. He'll be arrested," Mbalula told the broadcaster.Mbalula said he was concerned and could not understand why Manana had not been arrested, even after charges of assault were laid against him.Victim Mandisa Duma broke a rib, busted a knee cap, had bruising on her body and was struggling to walk."If he is guilty, he will be punished," said Mbalula."He's not yet been arrested and I don't have the luxury to explain why he has not been arrested because there are certain processes that the police and the prosecution are following."
