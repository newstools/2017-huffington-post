25-year-old Sive Xelo is a visual artist who hand-paints footwear.   The Queenstown-born artist tells HuffPost SA that she has always had a natural flair for art - hence her decision to study Fine Art at the Nelson Mandela University.   After graduating in 2016, she had a desire of getting her art to a broader audience. So she started by designing shoes for herself - which people would be curious about.   They would subsequently order them -- and that's when she saw a business opportunity. Mid-2016, Sive's Walking Canvas was born. This is now her full-time job and her main source of income. Xelo admits that it hasn't been easy. One of the main challenges she has faced has been her growing clientele - some of whom "give her a run around when they have to pay after their order is done." Sourcing the material she uses on her designs can also be expensive and hard to source. Xelo does, however, believe in the potential of her business to grow. She says the support people have shown her in such a short space of time has been both surprising and encouraging. Her short-term goal is getting her Siva's Walking Canvas in a stable position - "where it can generate enough money to sustain itself even on not so busy months." Her long-term goal is owning a shop where she sells custom-made clothing items that are unique to individuals.   Although she is based in Queenstown, orders can be shipped to various parts of the country.
