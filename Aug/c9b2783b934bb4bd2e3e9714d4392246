Former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci on Wednesday accused New Yorker journalist Ryan Lizza of recording him without permission.In a tweet, Scaramucci called Lizza "the Linda Tripp of 2017" over the explosive interview that ultimately cost him his job.He wrote:.@RyanLizza is the Linda Tripp of 2017. People know. And he is up at night not being able to live with himself.Two decades ago, Tripp secretly recorded some of her conversations with Monica Lewinsky, the White House intern who had an affair then-President Bill Clinton.In response to a question, Scaramucci called Lizza a "lowlife":Yes. He absolutely taped the call without my permission. #lowlifehttps://t.co/fTDcBw4vcTHowever, in this comparison, Lizza being Tripp would mean that Scaramucci is Lewinsky a detail that not only drew immediate attention but also launched dozens of wisecracks:LOL of the day. If @RyanLizza is Linda Tripp, you know who that makes you, right? https://t.co/drPQTFTx7xFollowing @Scaramucci's analogy, that clearly makes him Monica Lewinsky. What's he trying to tell us about his relationship with Trump?You called a reporter. Commented on the record. D.C. has one-party consent for recording calls. Your argument is worse than your analogies. https://t.co/ZmHzcle02gMonica Lewinsky's tenure at the White House was 27 times longer than Anthony Scaramucci's. https://t.co/UqIuWY40eiTripp taped Lewinsky without her knowledge because she hated Clinton. Lizza taped you because that's what reporters do, Doofus.Thus making Anthony Scaramucci the Monica Lewinsky of 2017. https://t.co/MigNVKqfCpMonica Lewinsky served longer and did more for the public than Anthony Scaramucci.Tripp secretly recorded calls of Lewinsky talking about Clinton. Lizza recorded you b/c it was on the record and that is LITERALLY his job https://t.co/Ltbe3hW6aE
