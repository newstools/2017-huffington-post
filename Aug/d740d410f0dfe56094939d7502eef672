But it was this one picture in particular that grabbed the attention of Reddit users, who immediately began manipulating it in all kinds of amusing ways: They reimagined Putin dabbing, sat on the Iron Throne, à la “Game of Thrones,” and holding an American flag. President Donald Trump also made a not-entirely-unexpected appearance.
