It's an open secret by now that Black Coffee is ready to put his life story into a book. The DJ, real name Nkosinathi Maphumulo, tweeted on Monday that he was ready to tell his life story and that he wanted award winning Brazillian novelist Paulo Coelho, of "The Alchemist" fame, to write it. In his tweet, Maphumulo asked Coelho how many retweets (RT's) he would need on his post before Coelho would agree to write the book.  Responding to Maphumulo's tweet, South African author of the recently launched book, "MissBehave", Malebo Sephodi, said there were many authors on the (African) continent. She asked Maphumulo how many RT's it would take for him to consider giving the gig to a local writer to instead.  But Maphumulo wasn't interested and said in his reply that Sephodi could use those authors for her own book.  And then came the response from Coelho, which left tweeps with excitement that Maphulo's request might just be granted:  Tweeps were so excited.   Read: Apple Radio, Ibiza And More...
