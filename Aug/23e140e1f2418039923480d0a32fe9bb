Coffin assault duo Theo Jackson and Willem Oosthuizen, who were accused of forcing Victor Mlotshwa into a coffin and threatening him, have been found guilty of six of the seven charges against them in the High Court sitting in Middelburg on Friday.   The charges that both accused faced included possessing an unlicensed firearm, kidnapping, intimidation, defeating the ends of justice, assault with the intent to do grievous bodily harm, and attempted murder. Mlotshwa was allegedly walking on a footpath through De Beer's farm when he was confronted by accused Willem Oosthuizen who stopped him and told Mlotshwa that he didn't want a "k***" on his farm. The coffin assault case made headlines when footage showed two men threatening to pour petrol and set a coffin alight after their victim Mlotshwa was placed inside.
