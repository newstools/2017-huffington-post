"We didn't expect things to turn out like this" pic.twitter.com/YyA9TsBy9N  The charges that both accused faced included possessing an unlicensed firearm, kidnapping, intimidation, defeating the ends of justice, assault with the intent to do grievous bodily harm, and attempted murder. Mlotshwa was allegedly walking on a footpath through De Beer's farm when he was confronted by accused Willem Oosthuizen who stopped him and told Mlotshwa that he didn't want a "k***" on his farm. The coffin assault case made headlines when footage showed two men threatening to pour petrol and set a coffin alight after their victim Mlotshwa was placed inside. #coffinAlive We need a mass protest to the farm of the JM de Beer Broedery to do what he did to this black African & occupy it @afriforum pic.twitter.com/ztpT86h4q4
