You don't need to be Stephen Hawking to know that staring directly at the sun is not a good idea. And ahead of the United States witnessing its first total solar eclipse in almost a century, anyone with the most rudimentary medical knowledge was imploring everyone not to look straight at the rare celestial ballet. But this wasn't enough for US President Donald Trump, who eschewed sound advice and sunglasses in his defiance of common sense. Someone shouts "don't look" as Pres. Trump looks up without eclipse glasses on as solar eclipse passes over D.C. https://t.co/5ft70fm30Rpic.twitter.com/0lAkuzF9RZ Both of whom donned the correct protective eyewear ... pic.twitter.com/k7Kw8uAjae During the eclipse Trump saw his shadow -- so that's six more years of nuclear winter pic.twitter.com/sBfmYF4e51 I cannot handle this right now. pic.twitter.com/JXjuHH2ivA Preview of tonight's Tucker Carlson pic.twitter.com/DawbInUrWl HE FUCKING DID IT pic.twitter.com/d5th91PNpJ "The President of the United States did not stare directly at the #SolarEclipse.
