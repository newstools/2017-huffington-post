South Africa's Parliament in Cape Town is an exciting and historic place known globally as the site of the transition from the system of legalised apartheid to a free and democratic country.Since the EFF won representation after the 2014 election, it has become like the nation's bioscope with riveting political theatre making it a site of accountability and often of chaos.Today is likely to go down as another occasion eagerly watched by a nation on the edge of its seat. Will the president go or will he stay? Here's what is going to happen this afternoon.2pm The National Assembly is packed out as party chief whips have called three line whips to ensure their members are present. The motion of no confidence is debated by the top guns in all parties. Time is allocated according to the party's proportional representation, which is determined by its share of the vote at elections.The draft resolution by Mmusi Maimane, the leader of the opposition, resolves that Parliament "has no confidence in the in Mr J G Zuma as President of the Republic of South Africa on the grounds of his irrational, irresponsible and reckless leadership..."The motion says investor confidence plummeted after the president axed former finance minister Pravin Gordhan and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas and this plunged South Africa into an economic crisis. After the December 2015 firing of then finance minister Nhlanhla Nene, "President Zuma deliberately chose to repeat his actions, which is evidence that he has lost all all sense of rationality and sound judgement," reads the draft motion. "The economic crisis has led to job losses and it is felt most acutely by the poor and most vulnerable citizens."Mmaimane ends his draft call for a motion of no confidence with these words: "[President Jacob Zuma's] derelict leadership has resulted in a collapse of public confidence in [Zuma], created a government at war with itself and ultimately undermined efforts to restore confidence in the South African economy."The ANC has chosen four reliable and dependable supporters of President Jacob Zuma to oppose the motion. They are the party's deputy chief whip Doris Dlakude, former youth leader Pule Mabe, Minister of Defence and Military Veterans' Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqcakula and Arts and Culture Minister Nathi Mthethwa, who will sweep to close the debate.The opposition will deploy its most fiery guns in the form of the EFF leader Julius Malema, the DA will be represented by Phumzile van Damme, the UDM by Bantu Holomisa (who is responsible for the secret ballot) and COPE's Mosioua Lekota.Around 3.30pm The business of the National Assembly is suspended.The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) readies the room for the first secret vote of no confidence.
