Grace Mugabe, Zimbabwe's first lady and the woman accused of assaulting a 20-year-old model in South Africa, has reportedly purchased a R45 million mansion in Johannesburg, The Star reported on Thursday. She bought the 9249 square-metre property in Sandhurst through a shelf company in February. A property expert reportedly told The Star that the property was transferred to Grace Mugabe in May. The property reportedly has a summer house, six reception rooms, four bedrooms and four bathrooms, as well as a koi pond and a two bedroomed cottage pool. The property was reportedly guarded by Zimbabwean security guards this week. Grace also reportedly rented a R25 million mansion in Sandhurst on a year's lease earlier this year. Political analyst Brian Raftopoulos told The Star that Grace's recent property shopping showed she was "uncertain about her future". Grace has reportedly spent a lot of time in South Africa since her family left their R500 000-per-month Dubai home. Last year, Grace reportedly bought a R58 million mansion in Harare. On Wednesday, Robert Mugabe arrived in South Africa in what appeared to be an attempt to avoid a diplomatic fallout over the assault charges his wife is facing. Zim1 carrying Robert Mugabe and 45 other passengers arrived at Waterkloof Airport just after 7pm. Fourty six people have come to save Grace.  #RobertMugabe was only scheduled to arrive in SA on Friday for the SADC summit but changed his plans because of storm around #GraceMugabe.
