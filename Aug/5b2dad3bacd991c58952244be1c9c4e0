Public Enterprises minister Lynne Brown has instructed Eskom's Board to put together a report on its dealings with Gupta-linked company, Trillian, within two days. In a tweet from her department's official Twitter page, the department says Brown, requested the parastatal's Board members to "clarify" its business with Trillian but now she has instructed them to table a report within 48 hours. In June Minister Brown asked Eskom's Board to clarify its business with Trillian. Today she instructed the Board to table a report in 48hrs.   The instruction comes after Eskom admitted that it lied when it denied making payments totalling R1.6-billion to Trillian and global business consultancy, McKinsey. In June, Eskom said Oliver Wyman, another consultancy firm, concluded that all payments were above board. However, on Monday the parastatal admitted that Oliver Wyman in fact red-flagged the payments and recommended a legal review of the contracting process.
