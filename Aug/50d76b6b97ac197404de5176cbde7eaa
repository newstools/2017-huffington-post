The veteran actor, director and musician is one of the original actors and characters who has been with the soap since its inception in 2000. The Herald reported that Van Platzen's decision to leave the production was because of the change in management. "The new management had the writers and storyliners write stories for me and Hilda [his character's wife] that were boring and repetitive," he complained. He added:"It became a situation of the bad leading the badâ€š and the bad telling the other bad that they're actually not bad. They fell into a dwindling spiral that was hard to observe and be part of." Despite this his said he would miss the cast and crewâ€š with whom he had made many memories.
