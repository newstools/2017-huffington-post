Multi-Grammy award winnerJohn Legend will be back in South Africa in November as part of his 'Darkness and Light' tour. While people cannot contain their excitement, they have called on the "All of Me" hitmaker to bring along his wife, Chrissy Teigen. John Legend and Big Concerts announced his return to the country on social media to much fanfare.  Tickets for the shows will go on sale come Friday, August 25 and they will sell from R515 - R1140. Legend will make stops at the Ticketpro Dome on November 3 and 4, Moses Mabhida Stadium on November 7 and at Cape Town's Grand Arena on November 9 and 10.  While others are calling for him to receive permanent citizenship because of the number of times he's visited the country, others are just happy he respects his South African fans enough to visit while still at the prime of his career.
