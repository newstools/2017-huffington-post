(Reuters) Oscar Pistorius, the South African Paralympic gold medalist serving a six-year jail term for murdering his girlfriend, is back in prison after spending a night in hospital, a prison service spokesman said on Friday. Pistorius was taken to hospital on Thursday after reportedly suffering chest pains and was kept at the medical facility overnight for observation. "Oscar has been discharged and is back in prison," correctional services department spokesman Logan Maistry said. Prison officials have not disclosed details about Pistorius's illness, but local media reports said he suffered chest pains and prison staff suspected a heart attack. Last August, Pistorius denied trying to kill himself after he was treated in hospital for wrist injuries. He was transferred from the Kgosi Mampuru II prison to the Atteridgeville prison, also in Pretoria in November 2016. The athlete was sentenced to six years in prison in July last year after being found guilty of murdering his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, on Valentine's Day 2013.
