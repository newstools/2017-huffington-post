Campaign season in the ANC has looked decidedly different this year. First, there was the months-early endorsement of Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma by the ANC Women's League. "The Women's League did this just before the January 8 statement. I mean that was an incredible thing to do [considering ANC rules about the succession debate]... And to almost overshadow the ANC's biggest event of the year," says Stephen Grootes, host of the Midday Report on 702. "[ANC secretary-general] Gwede Mantashe said something into my microphone that Sunday: 'I used to be a sprinter in my youth and there is something like a false start.'" Then came the websites, newsletters, videos and social media updates. How do the frontrunners compare?

Dlamini-Zuma's total following on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram is bigger than that of the Ramaphosa campaign. However, if the proportion of Dlamini-Zuma's fake followers on Twitter is taken into account (30 percent according to TwitterAudit.com versus 2 percent for Ramaphosa) their total followers across the three social networks are neck and neck. The race won't be decided online as only 40 percent of South Africans are internet users and ANC branches have the biggest say, but the battle is certainly no longer analogue.
