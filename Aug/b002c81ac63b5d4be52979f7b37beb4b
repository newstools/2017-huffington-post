"It's not fair. You are trying to get a majority you don't have by choosing the secret ballot."

These were the words of President Jacob Zuma in Parliament in late June upon the Constitutional Court's declaration that National Assembly Speaker, Baleka Mbete had the power to decide on whether the vote of no confidence should be determined by open or secret ballot. On Monday, Mbete announced the vote against President Jacob Zuma would be determined by a secret ballot. In explaining her decision, Mbete said she had taken into account the "due independent and impartial consideration of all the legal, constitutional and political factors, especially those articulated in the Constitutional Court". She said she had taken this approach "in the interests of transparency and having taken into account the huge interest in this matter... expressed in various quarters of society".
