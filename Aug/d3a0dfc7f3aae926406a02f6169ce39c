Wayde van Niekerk gave an emotional interview on Thursday after winning silver in the 200m at the IAAF Championship in London. He broke down in tears and said he "deserved" what he had achieved in the past week. Van Niekerk ran six races in six days. He won gold in the 400m on Tuesday and took the silver in the 200m on Thursday. "There have been quite a lot of people that felt I didn't deserve it, I'm glad I could come out today and put out a good fight. I really believe this is just the beginning."  The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) has been quite hard on South African athletes. Van Niekerk broke down and sent a subliminal message to the broadcaster after they downplayed his achievements. Six races in six days took its toll on Wayde van Niekerk.

There's no double for the South African, he took silver.https://t.co/UvCpmCqjCjpic.twitter.com/Bk4lNDYJNk  Van Niekerk is becoming a national treasure in South Africa and locals took to Twitter to tell the BBC to keep its hands off our Wayde.
