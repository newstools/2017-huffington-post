Kendrick Lamar took top honors at the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards, scoring six trophies, including the evening's top award: Video of the Year. During his acceptance speech, Lamar gave a shout-out to the song's collaborators ― writer Dave Free and video director Dave Meyers. "Thank you for allowing us to take our thoughts and our wild imagination to the next level," he said. Meanwhile, some of the show's other categories had a completely different look. Not only did the VMAs do away with the term Moonman for 2017 (welcome, Moon Person), but the annual awards show also ditched gender categories. Gone were Best Male Video and Best Female Video, and in their place was simply: Artist of the Year. A slew of artists and celebrities took the stage at the Katy Perry-hosted ceremony in Los Angeles ― to both perform and accept their trophies. Going into the night, Lamar topped the list of nominees with eight nods, with Perry and The Weeknd not far behind with five each. SONG OF THE SUMMER Daddy Yankee and Luis Fonsi, Feat.
