A "cooling operation" is currently underway at Dubai's 79-storey Torch Tower after a large fire broke out at the building. According to the Dubai Media Office, no injuries have been reported after the 337-metre tall skyscraper -- which is one of the world's tallest residential towers -- was engulfed in flames in the early hours of Friday morning.  Earlier, burning debris could be seen falling from the Torch Tower in videos uploaded to social media by shocked onlookers.         The building -- which contains a total of 658 apartments and seven levels of parking -- was successfully evacuated by Dubai Civil Defence officials before the blaze could be brought under control. Witness John O'Nolan tweeted that power had been cut for the "majority of the north side of Dubai Marina" with only emergency lighting on in most buildings. "Lots of small fires still going, but bulk of the flames have burned out now," he said.      A spokesperson for Dubai Police told Gulf News that the fire broke out on the ninth floor of the building before spreading to upper floors. Both the Dubai Police Commander in Chief and Dubai Civil Defence Director General are currently at the site following measures to control the blaze.  According to the Dubai Media Office, there have been no reported injuries.  It's not the first time that the Torch Tower -- which was built in 2011 -- has been engulfed in flames. Residents were evacuated from the tower in 2015 after a fire swept through the tower.

During New Year's Eve celebrations in 2015, flames engulfed the 63-storey Address Downtown Dubai luxury hotel and residential block located just across from the Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest building. Following this, in December of 2016, firefighters battled to extinguish a blaze at a tower in the 14-storey Oceana residential complex on Dubai's famous man-made Palm Jumeirah island.
