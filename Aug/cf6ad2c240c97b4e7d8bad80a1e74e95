A motion is set to be tabled at the ANC's national executive committee meeting in KwaZulu-Natal on Monday, seeking a special NEC meeting to discuss the errant ANC MPs who voted in favour of a motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma, City Press reported. The party's highest decision making body meets on Monday, with the issue reportedly high on the agenda. Three MPs, Derek Hanekom, Pravin Gordhan and Makhosi Khoza are expected to be disciplined for voting in favour of the motion, but there have been calls for others to step forward. Last week, ANC MP Mathole Matshekga was among those who called for a special NEC to discuss the issue, according to The Citizen. Matshekga argued it would be "grossly unfair" to discipline those who had voted with the opposition as they were "victims of a corrupt state". ANC spokesperson Zizi Kodwa told City Press that no one had been charged, yet. He said that the national working committee had agreed to first talk to the MPs who voted with the MPs and said so publicly. ANC secretary general Gwede Mantashe reportedly said the party would not launch a witch-hunt to find out how its MPs had voted during the secret ballot. Only those who told the ANC to "go to hell" would be disciplined, he reportedly said. On Sunday, the MK Veterans Association called on ANC MPs to come forward and admit to voting with the opposition, the SABC reported on Monday. Chairperson Kebby Maphatsoe said there would be no witch-hunt, but that the veterans wanted to encourage those who voted with the opposition to come forward. "We're not going to do a witch-hunt as MKMVA but we're going to encourage those MPs who voted to come out and apologise. So we can't sit with a poisonous snake in the house because it will kill you. It's clear we're sitting with dangerous people within parliament who do not respect the decision of the organization," he reportedly said.
