President Mbete? President Sisulu? Sisulu was worried about the transition of the next president but stressed the importance of the ANC movement restoring pride within the party and in South Africa. "Whoever we put out there as a candidate for the ANC must be the kind of person who will make us win the elections," Sisulu said. "If the party wins in 2019, it will probably be with a very reduced margin. If we don't, we would have lost everything we ever worked for," she said. With the December elections around the corner, presidential candidates are rallying their supporters and pushing their agendas while Sisulu slowly gains support from local politicians in Polokwane.
