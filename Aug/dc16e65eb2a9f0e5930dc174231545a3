When the "man cold" strikes, it strikes hard. Of course, some men are total troupers when they're feeling under the weather. Others, however, have a tendency to melt into a helpless little puddle of sniffles while their wives go to work and take care of the kids, even when dealing with the same symptoms. (Research suggests some viruses may actually hit men harder than women, so science could be to blame!) The phenomenon has become a regular topic of discussion on Twitter, mostly among women married to men. Below, we've compiled 15 hilarious tweets from wives who have nursed their husbands through the man cold and lived to tell the tale. I'll be on my deathbed and my husband will still say, "Oh man.
