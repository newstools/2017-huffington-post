*Correction: This video's headline and content has been altered to make clear that, to date, Mr Mkhize has not publicly expressed explicit intention to run for ANC president despite nomination from the branch level. Wording has also been changed to emphasise more clearly that Mkhize has not been found guilty of any wrongdoing in the so-called 'Intaka scandal'.
