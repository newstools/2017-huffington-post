Princess Diana, arguably the most famous woman on the planet, was killed in a high speed car crash in Paris on 31 August, 1997. The 36-year-old was travelling in a Mercedes Benz S280, driven by Henri Paul, the acting head of security at the Ritz Hotel in Paris where Diana and her new lover Dodi Fayed had earlier shared their last meal. Paul, 41, was killed instantly in the crash, as was Fayed, 42. Diana died several hours later in hospital. Her bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones, then 29, was the only survivor.
