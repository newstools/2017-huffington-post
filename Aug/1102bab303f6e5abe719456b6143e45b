Parliament erupted into chaos on Thursday when President Jacob Zuma was answering questions on the state of affairs in the country.Members of the Economic Freedom Fighters stood up in a rage as tensions began to boil over, storming out of the House just before parliamentary security was called to force them out.This sent Twitter into a craze, with South Africans, being South Africans, reacting ever so comically to the craze....and then they walk out...along with them the entertainment. #ZumaQandA#ZumaQandA EFF is gone, lemme watch National geographic.EFF exit:Entire EFF contingent leaves with Ndlozi and Gardee. #ZumaQandA proceeds. @News24 pic.twitter.com/MVXMHkSkJEZuma was tackling questions over the fight against gender-based violence, the achievements of Operation Phakisa, the investigation into the South African Broadcasting Corporation and whether he influenced the awarding of state contracts to any of his family members or associates.Expecting Zuma to answer questions in Parliament is like expecting Kaizer Chiefs to spend money to sign quality players. #ZumaQandASome of the so-called honorable members behave like school kids really always have to be called into order #ZumaQandA.
