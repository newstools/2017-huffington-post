Gauteng police spokesperson Kay Makhubela says police are investigating a case of murder and attempted hijacking following the death of actor and musician, Dumi Masilela. The 29-year-old died in hospital after he was shot in a botched hijacking in Tembisa on Wednesday night. Gospel artist Andile KaMajola said Masilela's death was senseless."We are heartbroken by the rate at which we are losing our young stars to crime in South Africa. It's a terrible thing", he said. "My heart goes out to Dumi's young wife, Simphiwe, who now has a new title because a criminal decided to take her husband's life. It's too much now. Actually, we need to do better as a people." Masilela's fellow Idols SA Season 8 contestant, Khaya Mthethwa, paid tribute to Masilela on Twitter. From days of @IdolsSA season 8 when I met u @ sun city to this day, salute my sir. RIP Dumi Masilela.  With an emotional caption, Idols SA shared Masilela's first audition from Season 8 on social media. He was just 24 and a professional player when he auditioned for #IdolsSA S8. Here's his journey: https://t.co/QDx6t2eNoP#RIPDumiMasilela pic.twitter.com/OX0POsfD7q I didn't know until today that Dumi Masilela was married to Simphiwe Ngema.
