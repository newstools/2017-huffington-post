It’s OK to be jealous. It’s only human. Paris Hilton, known for her luxurious lifestyle, of course extends that posh life to her precious pups. Hilton posted photos to her Twitter account showing off her doggies’ Spanish Colonial mini-mansion. “My dogs live in this two-story doggy mansion that has air conditioning, heating, designer furniture, and a chandelier,” Hilton captioned the photos. “Loves it.” My dogs live in this two-story doggy mansion that has air conditioning, heating, designer furniture, and a chandelier. Loves it pic.twitter.com/4dXAf5XPXV These dogs are enjoying perks that most adults can’t afford. Designer furniture? We’re still trying to be trendy with a Target sales section budget. Hilton has had the doggy mansion for a while now, but that didn’t stop people from getting worked up over the photos she posted Friday. Hey sis can I be one of your dogs pic.twitter.com/hDsUyBDIin I'll never be able to afford a place like this for myself She's so extra and I fucking love it 😍😂💕 pic.twitter.com/aUrx8z5dXy But listen, wouldn’t we all do this? Pets are pretty much better than humans anyway. They’re more loyal, fun to be around and always seem to know when you need to be cheered up. If we had Hilton’s budget, we’d be putting up doggy mansions, too. Like this guy, who built his dog a really nice room decorated with sweet family photos. My brother built his dog a separate room in his house ! pic.twitter.com/ayjaEGBzf8 Anyone who loves animals would want to give them the royal treatment. My animals would have that too if I had won the $700M Powerball yesterday This is the level of luxury ALL dogs deserve 😩 https://t.co/e1oRsA7GfQ Share this slide:
