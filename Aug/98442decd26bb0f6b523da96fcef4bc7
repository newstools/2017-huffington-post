The assault allegation against Robert McBride, head of the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid), is not part of a smear campaign, his daughter told Eyewitness News. McBride's daughter opened a case of assault against her father, it emerged at the weekend. The daughter told EWN her claim of assault had nothing to do with his work. McBride has denied the allegations. "We have become aware of communication circulating amongst crime intelligence people, in which they discuss going after McBride,' Ipid spokesman Moses Dlamini told News24 on Sunday. "We also know those who are behind them. We have uncovered fraud, corruption, abuse of secret funds, and the targeting of civil society and individuals with slander. The work continues. We will not be distracted and have improved our security." The conspiracy was reportedly part of a dirty tricks campaign called Project Wonder, headed by rogue crime intelligence agents, which aims to discredit both McBride and police minister Fikile Mbalula. But McBride's daughter says she is not being used by anyone. "This stems from him hitting me on Sunday, it has nothing to do with his work," she told EWN. "I'm not concerned about his reputation or his line of work. I'm concerned about what he did to me, anything along those lines, those accusations are untrue." She claims that her father repeatedly punched her in the face.  "And then at that stage, we were at the traffic lights and he turned right and he had both hands around my neck and strangled me and he's like 'I'll kill you, don't tell me what to do or when to stop hitting you'."
