Earlier this month, one of the US's top beauty magazines, Allure, announced that it would stop using the expression "anti-ageing". Editor Michelle Lee explained in a letter: "Whether we know it or not, we're subtly reinforcing the message that ageing is a condition we need to battle." She is challenging the way we talk about ageing as a society -- hence their latest cover. "I could see why they called me sexy in those days. I fell into the cliché of sexiness: blonde hair, tits, waist, which I hated at the time because it was not fashionable. You had to be thin and have a cigarette and only wear black. And I just never fit into that look."

Africa you are Beautiful. Africa you are Powerful. Africa you are the Cradle of Humankind. Africa you are the Now. Africa you are the Future. Believe it. Embrace it. Celebrate it. Few embody this view better than Mama Esther Mahlangu cover star of the September #HeritageIssue of @destinyconnect on sale from tomorrow. We salute her for living her heritage with such dignity, authenticity, love and tenacity. We salute her for eloquently demonstrating that so long as we can breathe we can imagine. Through our imagination we can create a magnificent reality. What an inspiring icon she is. May she continue to rise and stir up in all of us a deeper love for our heritage, art and creativity. Halala Mama Esther! 🎉🙏💕Very well done @sheena0adams, @ladykemomo, @mpu_me and #TeamNdalo! ❤❤ Awesome photography my dear talented brother @victordlamini.👌💛 #TheFutureIsAfrican #HeritageIssue #LatestIssue #HalalaThings #WomanFulfillingHerDestiny #PositivelyImpactingLives #CelebratingAfricanExcellence 🌍💚🌍💙 A post shared by Khanyi Dhlomo (@khanyidhlomo) on Aug 20, 2017 at 11:26am PDT  Not only is the 81-year-old a heritage icon so worthy of being celebrated, but the cover defies the "cover girl" norm -- and that's why it's a double win for us. One just has to look at magazine stands in shops to see which type of woman and in which age category normally graces the cover of magazines. We grow up in a society that champions youth. We are taught, directly or indirectly, to fight ageing as much as possible because it equates to deterioration and weakness. The beauty industry overflows with products believed to "reverse ageing" and "keep wrinkles at bay". But how glorious are Mam Esther's wrinkles and grey hair? The portrayal is refreshingly realistic in an age of airbrushing. Who said beauty is and has to be one thing? Read: There Is No Reversing Ageing -- Maybe Slowing It Down, And Even Then It's Tricky What Destiny magazine has done is truly celebratory. They are challenging the representation of ageing in the media. And we can't downplay the important role mass media has to play -- because through its representation of older people, it communicates the meaning and experiences of ageing in a society. And it's not a lie that older people, especially over the age of 60, are generally under-represented in our media, never mind as cover stars. I wondered when the cover was announced, how many older women would go out and buy the magazine because "one of their own" was on the cover? I have also often wondered how many of our gogos and mkhulus feel they cannot relate to content in magazines because it's not nearly representative of them. But look at Mahlangu: So when I see this cover -- I see strength, wisdom, cultural pride, and the grace of God in keeping Mahlangu until 81. This cover may be paving a way in shifting cultural perception of ageing as we know it -- and we are here for it. Somizi Mhlongo put it best when he wrote on Instagram: "This is not just a cover. It's a memoir, a souvenir." This is not just a cover. It's a memoir. A souvenir. A must have in yo wall or coffee table. @khanyidhlomo and yo team. U have outdone yo selves. Good luck on topping this next month. This is the cover of the decade. Gogo Esther i bow A post shared by Somizi (@somizi) on Aug 20, 2017 at 11:00pm PDT So Destiny magazine, thank you.
