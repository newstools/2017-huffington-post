If there's one celebrity dad who knows exactly how to pull at our heartstrings, it's Dwayne Johnson. On Monday, the 45-year-old star shared a sweet birthday tribute to his eldest daughter Simone, and melted our hearts once again. Alongside a throwback photo, he wrote: "And just like that my baby girl @simonegjohnson turns 16. Feels like just yesterday I held her tiny body in my hands the day she was born as I whispered 'I'm gonna love and take care of you for the rest of my life.' She of course cried, which in newborn lingo translates to, 'you're the best damn daddy on the planet.' True story."

Keep your eyes on that prize, keep working hard and I got your back every step of the way. Now go have fun!" Cue the awws. The Rock has always shared a tight bond with Simone, who he had with first wife Dany Garcia. Not only does he frequently gush about her on social media, but has previously teared up while talking about their father-daughter relationship. In 2015, Johnson recalled a time when he asked Simone what she loved most about their bond. "She said, 'Well, that I trust you,'" he shared. "For a 13-year-old girl to say that to her dad... She said, 'I trust you, and we have a very special bond.'"
