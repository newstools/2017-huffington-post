South African hip-hop artist Cassper Nyovest is days away from his bid to fill up Africa's largest stadium. If he pulls it off, he will have have staged the biggest hip hop concert in the world. Read: Looks Like Cassper Nyovest Will Fill Up FNB Stadium -- And We're So Here For It The concert, called #FillUpFNBStadium, will take place on 2 December. Nyovest, 26, real name Refiloe Phoolo, said that tickets for the golden circle were almost sold out on Sunday.  After successfully filling up the 20,000 seater Ticketpro Dome, and (almost) the 40,000 seater Orlando Stadium, Nyovest is eagerly wishing for a similar outcome with his audacious attempt to fill the 90,000 plus capacity FNB stadium. All the glory to God!!!! He's forever so faithful!!!   FNB Stadium is the fifth largest stadium in the world with an official capacity of 94,736. 


                                                                


    
      Celebrities who have tried to pack the stadium include Brenda Fassie, Rihanna, U2, Justin Bieber and One Direction. The stadium also hosted the opening and closing ceremony of the 2010 Fifa World Cup. Here's the low-down on who came closest. Lady Gaga: 2012; 56,000 fans 


                                                                            


    
      Lady Gaga came to South Africa in 2012 as part of her Born This Way Ball Tour, which was held at FNB Stadium in Johannesburg. Her fans did come in their numbers but she did not manage to completely cram it full. Rihanna: 2013; 65,000 fans 


                                                                            


    
      Rihanna is one of most famous musicians to grace the FNB Stadium. Her 2013 Diamonds World Tour included her hit single "Diamonds" and South Africans came in their numbers. The attendance at FNB stood at 65,000. One Direction: 2015; 131,000 people over two days 


                                                                            


    
      One Direction clocked a capacity of 131,000 at the FNB Stadium over a two-day period. On its first day, the group performed to 68,000 fans and the following day to another 63,000. U2: 2011; 90,000 plus fans 


                                                                            


    
      Irish rock band U2 recorded the most number of fans for an official concert when more than 90,000 filled the stadium in 2011. To date, no other musician or band has reached audiences higher than this at FNB stadium. Bono and his crew, therefore, hold the record at the iconic stadium. Can Nyovest do it?
With Casper looking to #FillUpFNBStadium in less than a week, he will need all the help he can get. A major difference between Nyovest and the artists mentioned above is that they were international stars, and their threshold contributed to the mass capacity. But the rallying behind Nyovest by celebrities, businesspeople and politicians has been heartwarming. Black Coffee, Pearl Thusi, Vusi Thembekwayo and Police Minister Fikile Mbalula are amongst those who've pledged to buy tickets to fill up the stadium, while others have promised not to miss what promises to be the biggest night in local hip-hop history (so far).
