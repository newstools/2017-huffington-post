Renowned DJ and businessman Mthokozisi Khathi recently touched down Spain's popular island, Ibiza for a vacation with his wife, Gugu and if the pictures are anything to go by, the pair had all the fun. Taking to social media, they shared pictures that made us all wish we weren't sitting behind our desks just scrolling through their timelines, but rather on a beach somewhere also sipping on something nice. Here are the photos that are giving us the best feels: 🌞☀️   Toast to the good life 🍾🇿🇦 #MalumeInIbiza   💞🌞☀️#Ibiza  And they also got to watch South African national key point, Black Coffee, real name Nkosinathi Maphumulo, playing live. 🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦 A post shared by djtira (@djtira) on Aug 20, 2017 at 12:50pm PDT   Black Coffee has a residency at Hii Ibiza where he plays every Saturday.
