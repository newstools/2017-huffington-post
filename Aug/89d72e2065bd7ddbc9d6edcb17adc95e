We've been waiting with bated breath for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle to announce their engagement (the signs are there, right?), but when &mdash; and if &mdash; if actually happens, it will be on the palace's terms.According to People magazine, the news of a possible engagement won't come from a newspaper or magazine exclusive, it will come straight from Kensington Palace.Before an announcement is made, only those who are very close to the Prince and the "Suits" actress will be made privy to the information &mdash; people who are trustworthy enough to not leak the information to the media.There is, of course, royal precedent for this.As People notes, in the early morning of Nov. 16, 2010, the palace announced that Prince William and Kate Middleton were engaged, after being together (for the most part) for eight years.William actually proposed to Middleton that October during a private holiday in Kenya, so you can imagine that the couple wanted to wait to make the official announcement so they could tell close friends and family. It is, however, a foregone conclusion that the Queen already knew, as she must give permission to certain members of the Royal Family who want to marry.

After the announcement was made, Will and Kate &mdash; who became the Duchess of Cambridge after she married the prince &mdash; attended a photo call at St. James's Palace and did their first on-camera interview together.Another way the couple kept their engagement secret was that Middleton didn't wear the famed ring William proposed with until the official photo call.At the time, William and Catherine probably had very little say over how the announcement would be made, and if Harry and Meghan get engaged, they will most likely go through the same ordeal.
