Stanford Tourism has suspended the membership of the Beloftebos wedding venue after its refusal to host a wedding for a same-sex couple. The venue was also removed from Stanford Tourism's website. "Stanford is a village that focuses on community building, upliftment and inclusivity." Alex Thorne,29, emailed the venue to enquire about dates for her wedding. "I mentioned that this was a same-sex wedding, and assumed they'd have no problem with it." Thorne later received feedback from the venue stating that it would not be able to host the wedding. "Sensing that the issue might be my sexuality, I asked if it had something to do with the dates, and was sent an email explaining that their policy is to only cater to heterosexual weddings," she said.   The tourism body, which released a statement on Friday, said it would await official comment from Beloftebos.
