Energy minister Mmamoloko Kubayi has told Parliament that South Africa would go ahead with its plans to use nuclear power technology, The Times reported on Tuesday. In a written reply to a question posed by Economic Freedom Fighters MP Mzingisi Dlamini, the minister said that nuclear energy was the "declared intention of the government..." She was asked why government was pushing ahead with its nuclear plan when research by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) had shown that this would be more expensive than investing in renewable energy. "This option exists to ensure that key objectives of the National Development Plan 2010-2030, especially on socio-economic development and job creation are achieved..." she said. Kubayi reportedly added that the department was in the process of updating its Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) and that stakeholders would be updated soon. "I believe the department has recognised the importance of costs in this exercise and I believe it is important to afford us the room to engage and address all inputs we have received to date towards completing the task at hand."
