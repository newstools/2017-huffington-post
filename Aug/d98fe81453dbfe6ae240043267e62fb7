Edward Zuma has not been one to mince his words when it comes to his feelings about Pravin Gordhan and this week it was no different. Zuma was captured on video letting everyone know exactly what he thinks of the former finance minister. Journalist Phathisa Mfuyo posted the video on Twitter. Gordhan was giving an address during the Ghandi Memorial Lecture in Pietermaritzburg. "Pravin you are lying you are telling people lies, you sold the country to the white man in Stellenbosch," he is seen shouting. "I have always told you, you are a sell out...," he continued.

Zuma had written an open letter after Gordhan addressed a lecture at the University of Johannesburg on state capture. Zuma called Gordhan a stooge of white monopoly capital, and called Hanekom "vile". The South African Human Rights Commission confirmed it was investigating Zuma's remarks. A spokesperson, Gail Smith, told Business Day that the commission would communicate with Zuma what action to take. But Zuma hit back, calling the commission a "vile dog unleashed to maul the black majority, to manage them, to sanitise their history and to keep them in check when expressing their history and articulating their black pain."
