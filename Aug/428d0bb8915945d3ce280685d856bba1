Eskom is reportedly "dragging its feet" in taking action against its former acting boss Matshela Koko, as he has yet to go through a disciplinary hearing despite being put on special leave by the power utility three months ago, Business Day reported on Friday. Meanwhile, two senior Eskom officials who were fired this week for their involvement in controversial payments to Gupta-linked firm Trillian, have reportedly been reinstated. Law firm Cliffe Dekker Hofmeyr and auditors Nkonki reportedly recommended that disciplinary action be taken against Koko, and that he be charged with six counts of misconduct. This related to his failure to declare a conflict of interest when a company co-owned by his daughter received Eskom contracts. A letter seen by Business Day charges that Koko's conduct had "exposed Eskom to legal and reputational risk." "The charges, individually and cumulatively, have resulted in a complete breakdown of trust and confidence between you and Eskom," the letter reportedly states. The charge sheet alleges that Koko informed former Eskom group capital executive Abram Masango that he was aligned to the "wrong politicians". "It is alleged you (Koko) instructed Masango to take study leave with immediate effect, in order to ease political tension," it states. But after this, it appears as if Eskom all but let the matter go. Business Day reported that Koko was eventually only charged with two matters, produced on a flimsy document riddled with spelling errors. The matter was then left in the hands of a staff member who was junior to Koko. Eskom reportedly said a hearing date was in the process of being finalised and did not say what the reason for the delay was.
