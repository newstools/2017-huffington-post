President Jacob Zuma's son and brother to Duduzane, Mxolisi 'Saady' Zuma has been accused of soliciting a bribe in order to sway a tender in a company's favour using his connections to the government. Mxolisi allegedly tried to broker a R54-million bribe with Altech UEC, a subsidiary of technology giant Altron, to help the company secure a TV set-top box contract, reports the Sunday Times. Two executives in the company told the paper that Altech had planned to bribe Mxolisi. "We were told that Saady would use his father's influence to strong-arm the communications minister to swing the deal our way," one of them said. The paper is in possession of e-mails between executives of Altech UEC, Danie du Toit and Laurence Savage, revealing that the R54-million fee for Mxolisi was discussed in March 2015. Altron group executive for marketing and communications Zipporah Maubane reportedly denied the company tried to bribe Mxolisi to win the tender. "When the digital terrestrial television set-top box tender was issued in 2014, Altech UEC was the only local company with the capability and capacity to manufacture the set-top boxes. Altech UEC submitted a bid." Maubane said that Savage and Du Toit had since left the company but confirmed they "were approached by various parties and individuals, including Mxolisi Saady Zuma, looking for commercial manufacturing and supply partnerships in connection with the opportunity". She also told the paper : "No monies or fees were paid to any individual or party. Altech UEC did not win the tender."
