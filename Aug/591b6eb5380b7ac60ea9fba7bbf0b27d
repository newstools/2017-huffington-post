Come August 17, The Bioscope Independent Cinema in Johannesburg will screen the local short film, "Hair That Moves" for one night only. The film, which is the brainchild of writer and director, Yolanda Keabetswe Mogatusi, was recently part of the official selection for the Zanzibar International film festival's 20th-anniversary edition. In it, a story is told about how Buhle, an 11-year-old township girl attending a prestigious English school in the North, gets tired of being late all the time and thus being excluded. She sets out to enter a singing competition where she could possibly win a car and solve all her problems. However, in order to even have a chance at winning with her favourite pop star's song, she needs one key element... hair that moves. Buhle tries all sorts of things it but nothing works. She breaks her piggy bank to buy a magical hair relaxer that she saw on TV. However, things turn for the worst and she has to make a decision about what makes her feel pretty and confident. Tickets for the screening are available for R45 each and screening starts at 7.30pm. The film also recently screened at the Africa Film Trinidad and Tobago Film Festival 2017. It is now available on Amazon Prime. If the trailer is anything to go by, we cannot wait for the film to be developed into a feature film, a process which is currently underway.
