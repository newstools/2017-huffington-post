Zimbabwe's first lady Grace Mugabe has managed to pen her name on the list of high-profile individuals accused of assaulting women. Mugabe is alleged to have assaulted South African model Gabriella Engels after she reportedly found her with her sons at a hotel in Sandton. Engels reported she was assaulted with an extension cord and shared photos of her injuries on social media. Mugabe has since invoked her diplomatic immunity which would ensure she' does not get prosecuted for the alleged crime. AfriForum has since stepped in and offered to prosecute the case should the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) fail to do so. In came Gerrie Nel. Nel recently left the NPA and joined the organisation as the head of its newly formed private prosecutions unit and he has vowed to seek justice for Engels. While South Africans are relieved that Engels' case will not fade away as they called it, they have some advice for Mugabe, who might believe she will get away with this like she did when she allegedly attacked journalists in Singapore back in July this year. Sigh. So Mrs Mugabe, if you're reading this, South Africans would like to remind you of what Nel is capable of: His nickname is Bulldog and he has an appetite for high-profile cases, like yours -- he very often wins. With over 30 years of experience, Nel has a record that speaks for itself. He prosecuted, among others, former police commissioner the late Jackie Selebi, who was convicted of corruption in 2010. Selebi died in 2015 aged 64. Nel was also the chief prosecutor in the murder case against Paralympian champion Oscar Pistorius. He is a former head of the now disbanded crime fighting unit, The Scorpions and led the investigation into Selebi and Brett Kebble. Nel was also the founding head of Gauteng's division of the Hawks.  Viva #gerrienel! #gracemugabe chose the wrong country to mess with. pic.twitter.com/fglrk8D5Lx   With that said, good luck to you, Mrs Mugabe. We have a feeling you will need it.
