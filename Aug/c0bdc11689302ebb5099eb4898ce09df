Celebrity chef and cookbook author Zola Nene is the new judge of the Great South African Bake Off Season 3 and she could not be more excited. BBC South Africa announced on Wednesday afternoon that Nene would be taking over from former judge Shirley Guy who left the show to pursue other projects and spend more time with her family. Nene took to Instagram to share her excitement. I'm beyond excited to officially announce that I'm the newest member of the awesome SA Bake Off family! 🤗 🤗🤗I'm the new judge for Season 3! 🍰🍰🍰 #SABakeOff  Shooting is underway and the show, which sets out to find South Africa's best amateur baker, will air in October. Nene joins fellow judge Tjaart Walraven who has been with the show since it came to the South African shores in 2015 after the successful run in over 20 countries. Presenters Anne Hirsh and Lentswe Bhengu also return for the new series. Dot Dicks won the first season while 19-year-old Cait McWilliams took home the title in season 2.
