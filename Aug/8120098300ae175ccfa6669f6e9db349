When news broke that Mzwanele Manyi had acquired Gupta-owned media units ANN7 and The New Age on Monday morning, South Africans took to social media to congratulate him but some sought clarity -- others just wanted to understand. Manyi, who is a former CEO of Government Communication and Information System (GCIS) and cabinet spokesperson, is reported to have bought ANN7 for R300m while The New Age was sold for R150m. Messages of congratulations have poured in for Manyi, whom some have hailed a hero for "saving 7500 jobs" that would otherwise have been lost after the Bank of Baroda followed suit from South African local banks and closed all accounts belonging to Gupta-owned firms. Taking to Twitter in true South African form, people also expressed shock at the realisation that Manyi had R450m somewhere on him. Here are some of the reactions so far:   R450 million fam.
Four Hundred and Fifty Million Rand fam.
