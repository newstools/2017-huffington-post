It&rsquo;s hard to keep up with the&nbsp;allegations of copying&nbsp;facing Khloe Kardashian and her denim line,&nbsp;Good American. On this week&rsquo;s episode, we have some receipts.&nbsp;The controversy started last Friday, when fashion designer Destiney Bleu accused Kardashian on Twitter of copying&nbsp;designs from her line of bedazzled clothing for an upcoming Good American collection. She claimed&nbsp;Kardashian ordered a slew of items from her &ldquo;DBleudazzled&rdquo; line&nbsp;before similar-looking clothes appeared in an ad for Good American&nbsp;that Kardashian tweeted last week.&nbsp;On Sunday, Bleu received a cease and desist letter from Kardashian&rsquo;s attorney that denies Good American&rsquo;s design team had ever seen her clothes. Now, she&rsquo;s fighting back with documents that appear to show both orders of clothing billed to Kardashian and correspondence with Kardashian&rsquo;s stylist and assistant.The cease and desist called Bleu&rsquo;s accusations &ldquo;flagrantly false and defamatory&rdquo; and detrimental to Good American and Kardashian&rsquo;s business and reputation. It denies that the brand was even influenced by the DBleudazzled&nbsp;line of encrusted sheer bodysuits, citing bodysuit-wearing celebrities like Cher as inspiration.&ldquo;Good American&rsquo;s design team had never heard your name and never saw your samples,&rdquo; Kardashian&rsquo;s attorney wrote to Bleu in a June 4 e-mail. &ldquo;You are not the first person to ever design a mesh bodysuit with embellishments. You have neither a monopoly on nor copyrights for bodysuits, embellishments or mesh fabrications, which have been used over and over again in the fashion industry.&rdquo;Bleu&rsquo;s attorney, Stephen McArthur, fired back June 8 in a letter obtained by HuffPost. It contains a timeline listing instances of correspondence dating back to October 2016 between Bleu and Kardashian&rsquo;s assistant, as well as Kardashian&rsquo;s former stylist Monica Rose, and includes dates for when Kardashian allegedly placed custom orders with Bleu.&nbsp;The &ldquo;receipts&rdquo; don&rsquo;t stop there. Bleu&rsquo;s attorney attached invoices for three separate purchases from late 2016 through April that list Kardashian associates and &ldquo;KK&rdquo; as the customer.&nbsp;McArthur told HuffPost that he has not yet received a response to his letter from Kardashian or Good American.In a statement, a Good American spokeswoman told HuffPost Friday the entire controversy is &ldquo;little more than a cheap publicity stunt&rdquo;:Ms. Bleu&rsquo;s claim that Good American and Khloe Kardashian copied or stole her designs is flagrantly false and little more than a cheap publicity stunt and an attempt by Ms. Bleu to get her 15 minutes of fame.&nbsp;Ms. Bleu did not create the concept or design of a bodysuit with crystals &ndash; a fashion style that has been around for decades as evidenced by the fact that Cher has been wearing these styles for over 25 years. The Good American design team designed a range of eleven bodysuits and had never heard of Ms. Bleu or seen her designs.&nbsp;The letter from her lawyer sent to the press for no legitimate reason&nbsp;&ndash;- is outrageous, defamatory and misleading in the extreme. Good American will absolutely not stand for anyone trying to damage its reputation and plans to deal with this through the proper legal channels.Bleu&rsquo;s attorney noted in his letter that &ldquo;copying clothing and&nbsp; fashion is generally&nbsp; not intellectual property infringement.&rdquo; Such a charge , he wrote, is not the point.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is not illegal for Khloe to copy Destiney&rsquo;s&nbsp; designs &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp; it is just tacky, disrespectful, and in bad taste. There is also something deeply uncomfortable&nbsp; about someone with&nbsp; Khloe&rsquo;s&nbsp; wealth and power appropriating designs and fashion directly from a black&nbsp; woman with a small business without crediting her, making cheap knockoffs, and then attempting to&nbsp; threaten her into silence. You should be ashamed.&rdquo; &ldquo;If Khloe wants to continue stealing designs from indie creators and mass produce them with no credit,&rdquo; McArthur stated, &ldquo;then Khloe will rightly face judgment in the court of public opinion.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;See the full correspondence below:&nbsp;
