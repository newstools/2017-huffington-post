Accio feminism. J.K. Rowling doesn't have time for liberal men who hurl misogynistic insults at women â€” except to put them in their place. On Thursday, British Prime Minister Theresa May called a snap election that was thought to be an easy victory for her. It wasn't. May's Conservative Party lost seats to Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party, prompting Corbyn to tell May to resign. She didn't. The election results left Britain with a so-called hung Parliament. The minority government then struck a deal with the smaller Democratic Union Party in order to maintain leadership. Not everyone was pleased with this outcome. According to Rowling, a liberal man she follows, and has always liked, called May a "whore" on Twitter. So the British author promptly unfollowed the man and tweeted her explanation for doing so: Though Rowling's response is powerful, it isn't 100 percent perfect. While "whore" can be used as a slur, some people have taken issue with Rowling's claim that "comparing a woman with a prostitute" is inherently offensive. There is nothing more offensive than a woman of privilege who considers prostitutes as sub human. Perhaps Rowling, like the man she unfollowed, can take these criticisms and grow from them.
