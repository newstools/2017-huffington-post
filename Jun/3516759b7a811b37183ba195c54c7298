Men have been revealing the moment they knew they wanted to marry their partner and it&rsquo;s enough to make the least romantic among us feel warm inside.Their stories, originally posted on Reddit, are a reminder that big gestures aren&rsquo;t always necessary for stealing someone&rsquo;s heart.Sometimes, it&rsquo;s the smallest words or actions that make all the difference.Check out some of our favourite stories below.&ldquo;When I first told my father that I was dating someone new, he jokingly asked: &lsquo;What&rsquo;s her name? What does she do? What&rsquo;s her bra size?&rsquo;&ldquo;I told her about it, hoping to prepare her for his sense of humour and she thought it was hilarious. The first time they met she introduced herself by saying: &lsquo;Hi I&rsquo;m Stephanie. I&rsquo;m in college and I&rsquo;m a B-cup.&rsquo;&ldquo;My father was horrified, my mother was laughing hysterically and I was in love.&rdquo;-&nbsp;ihavemademistakes&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I left my favourite CD in her car (Dream Theater&rsquo;s &lsquo;Scenes From a Memory&rsquo;). She wasn&rsquo;t a huge fan, but put up with it whenever I listened. One day I was on the phone with her while she was driving and we said good-bye but she forgot to hang up. I waited a few seconds and I heard her singing along.&rdquo;-&nbsp;rab7&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We were three days into a month-long backpacking trip in southeast Asia. We were staying in a seedy hotel in Bangkok and she got a bad case of food poisoning - it was coming out of both ends for 24 hours.&ldquo;I, of course, became designated as her nurse. I was refilling her water bottle, getting her soup from the restaurant outside, keeping her company and, most importantly, emptying the trash bin she kept puking into.&ldquo;After one trip to empty her vomit bucket, I came back into the room and she was asleep. I looked at her and thought to myself: &rsquo;I&rsquo;m not even bothered by this. I&rsquo;d do anything for her. This is the woman I&rsquo;m going to marry.&ldquo;&lsquo;She&rsquo;s a disgusting barf fairy, but she&rsquo;s my disgusting barf fairy.&rsquo; Zero regrets.&rdquo;&nbsp;-&nbsp;Shittysuperintendent&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;When I was a young lad I had bought a pair of swords. Now for some reason I still had them, but when my now-wife agreed to come over my place I decided to hide them in a storage closet because why would any grown man have these?&ldquo;So, a while down the line, she was looking for something in said closet when I heard &lsquo;what the hell? You have swords? Why are you hiding these?!&rsquo; I was prepared to be mocked mercilessly, when instead she handed me one and then started swinging. It was about that time that I realised I was going to marry her.&rdquo;-&nbsp;thiga&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Our first date lasted 12 hours because we just couldn&rsquo;t stop talking. Our second date was supposed to be just dinner and it lasted almost two days. She drove away after the second date and I couldn&rsquo;t imagine my life without her in it. I was ecstatic to find out she felt the same.&rdquo;-&nbsp;TheVeryLst1&nbsp;&ldquo;We had gone on two or three dates before I asked her to &lsquo;be my girlfriend&rsquo; and I knew the instant she said yes that we would be married one day. Her eyes just lit up like nothing else when I told her I wanted to make things official. It has felt like I can read her mind since the day I met her. I know when she&rsquo;s happy, sad, upset, tired, annoyed, etc.&ldquo;I knew a few days before she asked me to move in with her that she was going to ask. We have been in sync pretty constantly, and I&rsquo;m incredibly lucky to be married to someone with whom I&rsquo;m so in tune. We dated for three years, but I knew from day one that we were going to be married. I don&rsquo;t really believe in &lsquo;soulmates&rsquo; or anything too mystical. However, if there was anyone who could change my mind about that, it&rsquo;s my wife.&rdquo;-&nbsp;chalks777&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We had a long distance relationship. We lived three-four hours away from each other the entire time we dated. We had met at a concert and traded emails and MSN info (classic). We emailed and chatted everyday, sometimes for hours. We poured our hearts out about our fears and dreams. I&rsquo;d go visit her every other weekend, and she&rsquo;d come once and a while my way.&ldquo;About three or four months into doing this, I was at home chilling at home playing some game in my room. My dad called up the stairs that I had gotten a package in the mail. So I, confused, came walking down the stairs. And there she was. She came up to visit as a surprise. Without thinking, I instinctively ran to her and hugged her and lifted her and spun her a bit. And I felt in my heart a wholeness. Like holding her filled in something I was missing. I knew then that I never would let her go (metaphorically speaking). Been married over nine years, and I still get that feeling when I hug and kiss her.&rdquo;-&nbsp;ThrowAwayTheTeaBag&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I got mad and yelled at her for some stupid shit because I had been in a toxic relationship prior to meeting her and I thought that what couples did (scream and argue). I expected her to yell back at me, but she just stared at me for a moment and asked if I was done. I said I was and she proceeded to explain to me that people who love one another do not treat each other that way. We can disagree with one another, but there&rsquo;s no reason to be mean. &lsquo;If we&rsquo;re going to be together, please don&rsquo;t be mean to me again.&rsquo; That was 26 years ago (we&rsquo;ve been married 25 years).&rdquo;-&nbsp;MacSteele13&nbsp;
