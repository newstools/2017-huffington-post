If you thought the guy who played Barney was a down-on-his-luck actor who took the role just to pay his rent, think again.&nbsp;Meet David Joyner, the man who wore the Barney costume for a decade on the TV series and for live performances. Joyner played the T-rex between 1991 and 2001, and recently spoke with TechInsider about his time as the purple dinosaur.&nbsp;Did you know the Barney costume weighs 70 pounds and can reach temperatures of up to 120 degrees inside? Or that Joyner has a degree in electronic engineering technology? Or that the residuals from &ldquo;Barney&rdquo; pay&nbsp;quite well?&nbsp;Now you do.&nbsp;Back in March, Joyner did an &ldquo;Ask Me Anything&rdquo; on Reddit. At the time, he revealed that going to the bathroom was not always an option in the costume (duh) and that there was some heated competition between the children&rsquo;s shows on PBS.&nbsp;&ldquo;After our [first]&nbsp;season on PBS, we were canceled,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;The new Program Director of PBS was a major supporter of &lsquo;Sesame Street.&rsquo; We did a grassroots campaign to get &lsquo;Barney&rsquo; back on the air. Thus increasing the number of fans.&rdquo;Barney forever.&nbsp;H/T BuzzFeedShare this slide:
