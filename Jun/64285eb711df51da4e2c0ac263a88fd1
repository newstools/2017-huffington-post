Comedian&nbsp;Bill Maher&nbsp;dropped a racial slur in a joke Friday on &ldquo;Real Time,&rdquo; and people erupted on social media.Bill Maher just said the n word, @BenSasse didn&#39;t look horrified, and the audience applauded. pic.twitter.com/kFAs1S3dyMWhile discussing the state of Nebraska, his guest, Sen. Ben Sasse&nbsp;(R-Neb.), told Maher, &ldquo;We&rsquo;d love to have you work in the fields with us.&rdquo;Apparently confused by the invitation, Maher joked&nbsp;&ldquo;Work in the fields? Senator, I&rsquo;m a house n****r!&rdquo;Sasse looked uncomfortable, and the audience reacted with a mix of claps and groans.&nbsp;Then Maher, a critic of political correctness, followed up his remark by pointing out the sarcasm. &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s a joke,&rdquo; he said.The &ldquo;Real Time&rdquo; audience seemed to quickly forgive the host with a round of applause. Waving off the reaction with his hand, Maher replied, &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;People on Twitter, however, weren&rsquo;t so forgiving.&nbsp;But really, @BillMaher has got to go. There are no explanations that make this acceptable. pic.twitter.com/K5XlEjekQ9. @billmaher is a racist and bigot. @HBO must fire him this is not acceptable https://t.co/nlmFcDoWAkBill Maher must be fired immediately for his racism and belittling the struggle of millions of black AmericansHis fans reminded Maher that the word is completely off-limits to him and any person who isn&rsquo;t black even if the comedian rejects PC policing.Some are comparing Maher&rsquo;s joke with Kathy Griffin&rsquo;s shocking photo shoot of her holding a likeness of Trump&rsquo;s bloody severed head, which outraged conservatives and liberals alike.I&#39;m a huge Bill Maher fan, but he just said (as a joke in his mind), &quot;I&#39;m a house nigga&quot;. Off limits, Bill. Not cool at all!@billmaher jokes have limits. high level of carelessness &amp; indifference is destructive. Notice how Kathy Griffin self-destroyed!Me When bill maher just casually drops the n-word #Realtime #Billmaher pic.twitter.com/VUbKu2OKL0They just clapped like Bill Maher didn&#39;t say anything offensive pic.twitter.com/AIWqbBnhnjOne of Bill Maher&#39;s black acquaintances, please smack him? Bill, you don&#39;t get a pass. #billmaher #RealTimeOthers are recalling how Maher has previously faced&nbsp;accusations of Islamophobia&nbsp;and was criticized for &ldquo;normalizing&rdquo; alt-right troll Milo Yiannopoulos&nbsp;when interviewing him on his show in February.People shocked at Bill Maher being racist-y, check w your Arab &amp; Muslim friends. Been doing this for a LONG time, but he got hall passes.For folks finally denouncing @billmaher now: you&#39;re saying while transphobia &amp; Islamophobia are ok, anti-Blackeness is where you draw a lineRemember when Bill Maher had Milo on? &amp; Milo disrespected the 2 black guests, @larrywilmore and @MalcolmNance. Remember how quiet Bill was? Sasse later revealed on Twitter that he wished he&rsquo;d held Maher to account over the comment at the time, and admitted that &ldquo;cringing last night wasn&rsquo;t good enough.&rdquo;Am walking off a redeye from LAX. 3 reflections on @billmaher 1. I m a 1st Amendment absolutist. Comedians get latitude to cross hard lines.2. But free speech comes with a responsibility to speak up when folks use that word. Me just cringing last night wasn t good enough. (2of4?) https://t.co/e4Bw8s8tV23. Here s what I wish I d been quick enough to say in the moment: Hold up, why would you think it s OK to use that word?... (3of4?) https://t.co/mQL6wMEd7W(4of4) &quot;...The history of the n-word is an attack on universal human dignity. It s therefore an attack on the American Creed. Don&#39;t use it. https://t.co/kEZm5vPFHKMaher hasn&rsquo;t responded to the outrage yet, and, if he does, it probably won&rsquo;t be an apology.The comedian,&nbsp;whose career hinges off his no-holds-barred sarcasm,&nbsp;believes that PC culture has become a dangerous vehicle in today&rsquo;s politics and has warned Democrats to &ldquo;ease up on the identity politics.&rdquo; He&rsquo;s even blamed PC culture&nbsp;for President Donald Trump&rsquo;s win.But if people are wondering if it&rsquo;s OK for Maher to casually drop the slur as a joke, we&rsquo;ll let the Twitter outrage answer that question.Just watched the Bill Maher clip. pic.twitter.com/wDcENLICKAThis article has been updated to include Sasse&rsquo;s reaction to Maher&rsquo;s comment and background on the comedian&rsquo;s previous controversies.Share this slide:
