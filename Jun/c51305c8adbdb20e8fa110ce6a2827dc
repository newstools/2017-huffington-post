The storm is expected to carry on until 06 a.m. [on Thursday]," he said.According to Disaster Management's Charlotte Powell, their NGO partners were helping by providing hot meals, blankets and clothing to assist those affected.

We are climbing closer to 1 500 people who are taking up room in our formal beds."We offer those who are homeless blankets as it gets colder, food and general hospitality for about 10 days.
