A former McDonald&rsquo;s employee is suing the company&nbsp;and a franchise owner after she says she was sexually harassed and subjected to discrimination on the job because she identifies as transgender.&nbsp;In a May 25 lawsuit,&nbsp;La&rsquo;Ray Reed claims her superiors at a McDonald&rsquo;s in Redford, Michigan,&nbsp;subjected her to &ldquo;extreme sexual harassment and disparate treatment.&rdquo; The 25-year-old, who worked at the franchise full-time between April and August 2015, said she was referred to as a &ldquo;boy-slash-girl&rdquo; and relegated to using an unused bathroom that had been serving as a storage closet because she is trans. She also claims her genitals were groped.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I am transgender, but I have never dealt with anything like that, especially in the work field,&rdquo;&nbsp;Reed said in a video released Thursday by the workers&rsquo; rights group Fight for $15, which is locked in a legal battle with McDonald&rsquo;s to improve employee pay and conditions. She noted that her hours were slashed, and she was eventually fired, after she spoke to a manager about the abuse. &ldquo;They actually took me off the schedule,&rdquo; she said in the clip, which can be viewed above. &ldquo;So with that being said, it was even more stressful, even more depressing.&rdquo;&nbsp;Though McDonald&rsquo;s has a history of supporting the LGBTQ community, several queer advocacy groups said the lawsuit implied that the company&rsquo;s inclusive efforts may be hypocritical.&nbsp;&ldquo;McDonald&rsquo;s can&rsquo;t pinkwash its record of harassment and discrimination against LGBTQ workers with a fry box and a parade float,&rdquo; Pride at Work&nbsp;executive director Jerame Davis said in a press release.&nbsp;&ldquo;It will take a real commitment to equality and better treatment for its workers to address the horrific allegations in these complaints.&rdquo;&nbsp;Reed, who is seeking damages for loss of wages, emotional pain and loss of self-esteem, filed the lawsuit in an effort to &ldquo;show that trans lives matter,&rdquo; said attorney Anthony D. Paris of the Sugar Law Center for Economic and Social Justice&nbsp;in an email to HuffPost.&nbsp;&ldquo;She wants to stand up for herself and the other employees of a billion dollar industry, to show that it&rsquo;s not okay to sexually harass and discriminate against the employees who work for you,&rdquo;wrote Paris, who is representing Reed. &ldquo;She wants them to know it&rsquo;s not okay to treat their employees that way, and they can&rsquo;t get away with it.&rdquo;Reed &ldquo;knows she is not the only person,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s happened to others and its gone on for too long, so she is standing up for herself and for others.&rdquo; &nbsp;HuffPost has reached out to McDonald&rsquo;s for comment on the lawsuit. A company spokesperson told the Detroit Free Press,&nbsp;&ldquo;As a company, we are committed to the well-being and fair treatment of all people who work in McDonald&rsquo;s restaurants and discrimination of any kind is completely inconsistent with our values.&rdquo;&ldquo;As this is an ongoing legal matter involving an independent owner operator,&rdquo; the spokesperson continued, &ldquo;we cannot comment further.&rdquo;&nbsp;Read the full complaint filed by Reed below.&nbsp; La Ray Reed vs. McDonald&#x27;s Complaint by Noah Michelson on ScribdFind ways to combat bigotry by subscribing to the Queer Voices newsletter.&nbsp; &nbsp;
