Zola the gorilla has become a viral hit for his twirling moves in a tub at the Dallas Zoo.But there was something missing &ldquo;Flashdance,&rdquo;&nbsp;the 1983 film featuring Jennifer Beals as a steel mill worker who tries to prove her worth as a dancer.And CBS DFW obliged by adding the movie&rsquo;s smash-hit song &ldquo;Flashdance ... What A Feeling&rdquo; by Irene Cara as a soundtrack to the zoo video, above.But the CBS affiliate wasn&rsquo;t the only one.
