Once the darling of the sharing economy, Uber is knee-deep in a public relations crisis that has culminated in the resignation of its co-founder and CEO, Travis Kalanick. His shareholder-demanded departure is only the latest in a series of ousters and resignations at the company. In the last six months, the ride-hailing app has hemorrhaged high-ranking leaders as allegations of sexual harassment, a toxic workplace culture, corporate subterfuge and profiteering came to light and played out in viral social media campaigns ― and those are apparently just the tip of the iceberg. Kalanick’s resignation doesn’t come as a surprise -- after he was caught on video chewing out an Uber driver who questioned the company’s compensation policies in February, even he admitted he needed “leadership help.” If the vacancies at the top of Uber’s ranks indicate anything, the whole company needs it.
