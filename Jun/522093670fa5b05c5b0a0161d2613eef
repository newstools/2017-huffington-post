Germany&rsquo;s parliament on Friday passed legislation legalizing same-sex marriage &nbsp;a sudden landmark shift for LGBTQ rights in Europe&rsquo;s most populous country.The vote came days after Chancellor Angela Merkel signaled that she was open to changing Germany&rsquo;s marriage laws to include same-sex couples, prompting a hurried push from opposition lawmakers to pass the so-called marriage-for-all legislation.&nbsp;Merkel&rsquo;s ruling coalition had long opposed a vote on same-sex marriage, an issue that is divisive among her conservative bloc. But during an interview on Monday with German women&rsquo;s magazine Brigitte, Merkel said she was open to members of her coalition voting their conscience, rather than holding the party line.&nbsp;Merkel&rsquo;s shift came after she visited a lesbian couple raising eight foster children. She called her dinner with the family &ldquo;a life-changing experience&rdquo; and said she realized her party&rsquo;s arguments against same-sex marriage were no longer valid.&nbsp;LGBTQ-rights groups and analysts, however, viewed Merkel&rsquo;s about-face as a way for her to shut down criticism from pro-marriage equality opposition parties ahead of Germany&rsquo;s general election later this year.Merkel&rsquo;s comment sparked&nbsp;rapid reactions from opposition politicians, who called for immediate action on the issue. The leader of Germany&rsquo;s Social Democratic Party, Martin Schulz, demanded a vote within the week. Schulz is trailing Merkel in opinion polls.Some of the more conservative lawmakers in Merkel&rsquo;s Christian Democratic Union opposed the legislation and blamed the chancellor for shifting her political stance.Polls show that a strong majority of German voters favor same-sex marriage. A Federal Anti-Discrimination Agency survey earlier this year showed 83 percent of Germans support it.Germany has allowed civil partnerships since 2001. But unlike many neighboring countries, it has lacked full same-sex marriage equality. A growing number of countries in Europe have&nbsp;legalized same-sex marriage, including Finland and Slovenia this year. Italy remains among European states that permit only civil unions and do not grant full rights afforded to married couples.
