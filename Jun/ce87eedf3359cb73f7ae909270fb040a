Business confidence in South Africa has plunged to levels last witnessed in 2009 after the global financial crisis, according to the RMB/BER Business Confidence Index (BCI) figures released on Wednesday.The BCI collapsed by 11 points to 29 in the second quarter of 2017 as confidence declined across all of the five sectors of the economy surveyed. The index registered between 32 and 42 points over the last year, suggesting the latest decline "might signal that the current business cycle downswing is becoming even more pronounced", according to the Bureau for Economic Research.According to Fin24, seven out of 10 respondents were pessimistic about business conditions. This follows 43 months of an ongoing downswing in business confidence, the second longest in South Africa's history since the downturn between 1989 to 1993."For the RMB/BER BCI to have fallen in the way it has, so late in the current downturn, is concerning to say the least," the report warns according to Fin24."While the Cabinet reshuffle and consequent sovereign credit rating downgrades undoubtedly played a role, confidence was also knocked hard by persistently weak business activity."READ: Beyond Zumanomics: 3 Fundamental Problems With SA's Economy That Need To Be AddressedSA is quickly falling out of favour with investors --&gt; SA business confidence tanks via @Fin24 https://t.co/NZuwKkuc4iLow business confidence = low investment.
