Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and former President Barack Obama left their ties at home Tuesday night as they casually dined at a Montreal restaurant. Obama had earlier addressed a crowd of 6,000 people at the Montreal Board of Trade during his first post-presidency visit to Canada. He did not mention President Donald Trump by name but denounced the current administration's lack of leadership on climate change and diplomacy. Following the event, Obama and Trudeau headed to the St. Henri neighborhood for dinner. According to the Montreal Gazette, people crowded outside Liverpool House to get a look at the two leaders. Liverpool House is the popular sister restaurant to the trendy eatery Joe's Beef. People on Twitter loved it. Some hoped for a cameo appearance by France's new president, Emmanuel Macron, while others complimented the pair on their restaurant choice. its like obama and trudeau saw all the memes and said "let's do dinner, for the fandom" Nice to see President Obama visiting our best local restaurants. @joebeef üëç‚ù§Ô∏è #eatlocalpic.twitter.com/KDnHysRjfo A Prime Minister and.

And, of course, some wondered if the dinner jeopardized a certain bromance. ^ 'Memories, light the corners of my mind
