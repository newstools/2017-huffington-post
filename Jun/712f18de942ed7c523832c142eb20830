People online poked fun at the way President Donald Trump's cabinet lavished praise on their "dear leader" during its first gathering on Monday. Many likened the footage of cabinet members eulogizing Trump to an episode from his reality TV show "The Apprentice." Here's how Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) responded: Some Twitter users said the meeting bore a striking similarity to a scene from the "Harry Potter" movie franchise, while others questioned whether North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un's cabinet members acted the same way. Check out some of the best responses below: So is anyone going to put the photo of Trump's sycophantic cabinet meeting next to this one of Voldemort's at Malfoy Manor? pic.twitter.com/5n7xaBZNIH Trump cabinet meeting is a fascinating depiction of what seems to be a meeting to pat Trump on the head and tell him he's a good boy. @Cabinet@realDonaldTrump Today's cabinet meeting had all the lick spittle toadyism and sycophantic flattery typical of Venezuela or N Korea Trump cabinet meeting sycophantic spectacle. Like tacitus' description of the roman senate kissing nero's ass. The body of Trump, the blood of Trump...our communion Turns out Trump isn't Julius Caesar, he's King Lear. King Lear directed by Mel Brooks "And the Lord was pleased, and bestowed much favor upon Reince Ben Richard, until he was wroth with him." https://t.co/zEY67f3cc2 "Which of you shall we say doth love us most?" https://t.co/oHk0xWE2dx With tough love like this, it's shocking that they can't get Trump to act presidential... https://t.co/oH0OS5dYy6 This interminable cabinet spray, where everybody pays tribute to Trump, is one of the most exquisitely awkward public events I've ever seen. He absolutely would never ask anyone for loyalty though. Completely out of character. https://t.co/hVldvLyOtn
