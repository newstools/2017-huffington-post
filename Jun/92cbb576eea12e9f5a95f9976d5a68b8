Kylie and Kendall Jenner have pulled a new line of T-shirts from their online store after the mother of Notorious B.I.G. lashed out at the sisters for using her dead son&rsquo;s photo on their clothing, and after his estate reportedly threatened a lawsuit&nbsp;over the unlicensed images.&nbsp;Pictures of Biggie (Christopher Wallace), as well as of Tupac Shakur, rappers who were both killed in drive-by shootings more than 20 years ago, were featured on the line of $125 &ldquo;vintage rock&rdquo; T-shirts, along with images of Kendall, 21, and Kylie, 19.&nbsp;&ldquo;The disrespect of these girls to not even reach out to me or anyone connected to the estate baffles me,&rdquo; Voletta Wallace wrote on Instagram Thursday. &ldquo;I have no idea why they feel they can exploit the deaths of 2pac and my Son Christopher to sell a t-shirt. This is disrespectful, disgusting, and exploitation at its worst!!! I am not sure who told @kyliejenner and @kendalljenner that they had the right to do this. The disrespect of these girls to not even reach out to me or anyone connected to the estate baffles me. I have no idea why they feel they can exploit the deaths of 2pac and my Son Christopher to sell a t-shirt. This is disrespectful , disgusting, and exploitation at its worst!!!A post shared by Voletta Wallace (@volettawallace) on Jun 29, 2017 at 9:31am PDTTMZ reported that an attorney for the Notorious B.I.G. estate sent a &ldquo;cease and desist&rdquo; letter to the Jenners&nbsp;Thursday ordering them to stop selling the shirts with the rapper&rsquo;s image, and gave a deadline of 5 p.m. Friday.All of the shirts vanished from the store site Thursday; they had gone on sale Wednesday.Kendall Jenner posted an apology for the shirts Thursday, saying the designs were &ldquo;not well thought out.&rdquo;&ldquo;We deeply apologize to anyone that has been upset and/or offended, especially to the families of the artists. We are huge fans of their music and it was not our intention to disrespect these cultural icons in any way,&rdquo; she wrote. pic.twitter.com/wfcNyNBgVeThe T-shirt line also used photos from Metallica, Pink Floyd, the Doors, Kiss, and former Black Sabbath frontman Ozzy Osbourne.Ozzy&rsquo;s wife, Sharon Osbourne, zinged the sisters in a tweet: &ldquo;Girls, you haven&rsquo;t earned the right to put your face with musical icons. Stick to what you know...lip gloss.&rdquo;Girls, you haven t earned the right to put your face with musical icons. Stick to what you know lip gloss. pic.twitter.com/BhmuUVrDBnThe sisters also got a heap of criticism from music fans on social media.Why would Kendall and Kylie Jenner think they could just plaster their faces and initials over Biggie and Pac? pic.twitter.com/Mh0yZWKzxwKendall Jenner, who called Tupac her &ldquo;spirit animal&rdquo; in a Vogue video last year, was blasted in April after appearing in a controversial Pepsi ad in which she played a model who calmed tensions between police and protesters in a vaguely social-justice-themed demonstration by handing an officer a Pepsi. The ad caused such an uproar that Pepsi pulled it off the air.It&rsquo;s been a tough couple of weeks for the Jenner-Kardashian clan. Kim Kardashian earlier this week was criticized after she posted a photo of her son, Saint, in a car seat facing the wrong way. She was also lambasted for a photo last week launching her new makeup line that showed her with darker skin, which some observers called &ldquo;blackface&rdquo; and claimed had been digitally altered. She said she was just &ldquo;really tan&rdquo; that day.#KKWBEAUTY Creme Contour &amp; Highlight Kit 6.21.17 https://t.co/PoBZ3bhjs8 pic.twitter.com/hXLa3XHuVBAnd earlier this month,&nbsp;fashion designer Destiney Bleu&nbsp;accused&nbsp;Khloe Kardashian&nbsp;of copying Bleu&rsquo;s bedazzled clothing designs for Khloe&rsquo;s new Good American collection. Kardashian denied the clothing was a copy of Destiney Blue&rsquo;s creations.
