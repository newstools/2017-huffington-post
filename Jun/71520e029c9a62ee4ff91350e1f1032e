Lilly Singh has had enough with the racist, ignorant comments some people leave on her videos. The popular internet personality, who goes by the name IISuperwomanII on YouTube, systematically tore down her haters in a viral video that promised to give her trolls the geography lesson they desperately need. The tirade was prompted by a troll whose comments seemed to reveal a pitiful lack of knowledge about the world. “When something horrible happens in the world, you’ll see the rise of two types of people,” Singh said in the video. “Number one, people who don’t let fear divide them and instead choose to come together. And number two, racist idiots who don’t deserve an internet connection.” The commenter apparently told Singh, a Canadian Sikh of Indian heritage, to “go bak to ur country, you terrorist paki afghan indian muslim slut #MakeAmericGreatAgain.” “If you’re going to be racist, at least do it right,” Singh said about the comment, before launching into a “Geography Class for Racist People.” In the video, Singh stood in front of a world map and took her viewers on a journey to the imaginary country of “Paki Afghan India.” She reveals to her audience that these are actually three different countries. “You silly American Aussie Brit,” she sighed. She touched on a number of other issues, aiming digs at President Donald Trump, Fox News, and at trolls’ lack of education about the world outside America. Singh, a proud Sikh, defended Muslims against stereotypes about Islam. “Although there are approximately 175 million Muslims in India, there are approximately 2 billion in the whole world. Which means if every Muslim was a terrorist, you wouldn’t stand a goddamn chance,” she said. “Good thing they’re not.” By Friday, just one day after the video was published on YouTube, it had already racked up more than 1.5 million views.
