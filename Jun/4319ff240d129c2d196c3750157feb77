The trailer for &ldquo;Black Panther&rdquo;&nbsp;has finally arrived and, by the looks of it, this Marvel world will take us on one helluva ride.In the nearly two-minute teaser, Chadwick Boseman reprises his role as T&rsquo;Challa (aka the&nbsp;Black Panther)&nbsp;and returns home as king of Wakanda a mysterious, powerful and vividly colorful African world. There, we meet a star-studded cast with Lupita Nyong&rsquo;o&nbsp;as Nakia, Danai Gurira as Okoye and, T&rsquo;Challa&rsquo;s nemesis, Erik Killmonger, played by Michael B. Jordan.The teaser, which dropped during Game 4 of the NBA finals, opens with Klaw (Andy Serkis) chained to a chair asking Everett K. Ross (Martin Freeman) what he knows about Wakanda. When Ross says that it&rsquo;s a third world country with &ldquo;cool outfits,&rdquo; Klaw reveals Wakanda&rsquo;s true secret, claiming that he is the only person to have ever seen the country and make it out alive.&nbsp;&ldquo;Explorers have searched for it, called it El Dorado,&rdquo; Klaw growls. &ldquo;They looked for it in South America, but it was in Africa the whole time.&rdquo;Wakanda, as it appears in the trailer, is a mix of traditional and modern, natural and sleek, and is brimming with waterfalls.&nbsp;Its people are as Ross had suggested &mdash;&nbsp;ornate and vibrantly dressed &mdash;&nbsp;but they also prove to be as fierce as T&rsquo;Challa himself.And, of course, a generous amount of time was used to show the Black Panther&rsquo;s own super-hero strength and impenetrable armor.While the trailer is packed with action and fantasy, Boseman&rsquo;s co-star Sterling K. Brown has said that the film raises &ldquo;really provocative questions&rdquo;&nbsp;and is &ldquo;politically astute&rdquo; and &ldquo;socially relevant.&rdquo;&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not just an action film,&rdquo; Brown told Entertainment Tonight. &ldquo;It addresses the climate today of Africans and African-Americans across the country and across the world in a way that people will really be excited about.&rdquo;&ldquo;Black Panther,&rdquo; directed by Ryan Coogler and based on the comic book series (for which Ta-Nehisi Coates is currently writing), is due to screen in theaters this February.This story has been updated to show that Ta-Nehisi Coates is one of many writers contributing to the &ldquo;Black Panther&rdquo; series.Share this slide:
