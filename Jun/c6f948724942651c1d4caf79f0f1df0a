Women are enjoying an historic moment in British politics. On Thursday, voters in the United Kingdom elected a record number of female politicians to office. The final figure of female Members of Parliament had yet to be confirmed Friday morning ‚Äï but the tally had reached 201 by 9 a.m. local time.
