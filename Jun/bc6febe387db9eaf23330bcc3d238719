Polygamist Musa Mseleku's first wife, MaCele aka mamkhulu is a real queen mother and we love it.

And she knows it. A post shared by MzansiMagic (@mzansimagic) on May 13, 2017 at 5:30am PDT In a previous episode, because she had flu, MaCele bowed out of a traditional ceremony because impepho was too much for her to handle. And in another, she almost tore at wife number three, MaKhumalo, for expressing an opinion different to hers. And if last night' episode is anything to go by, we think we can safely add 'human' to the what-we-know-about-MaCele list. At a party thrown to celebrate her, MaCele said: "He can take more wives today because I know he won't treat me any differently."   And while some have called her behaviour princess-like, mean, bullyish even, the tears shed yesterday showed that behind all that is a human being. One who, it seems, has been carrying a lot.   When the show made its debut a few weeks ago, Musa Mseleku told HuffPost SA, "All my wives are human. What you will see will not be staged, just our life."
