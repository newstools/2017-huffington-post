The man accused of killing Karabo Mokoena was denied bail in the Johannesburg Magistrate's Court on Friday. Sandile Mantsoe, 27, was arrested after his ex-lover's body was found burnt beyond recognition in a veld in Lyndhurst, Johannesburg, in April. Mantsoe, who is a forex trader, is also accused of defeating the ends of justice. The man - who is originally from Mpumalanga but currently based in Sandton - is described as being deeply religious, quiet, and calm. He was also described by a fellow church-goer as an evangelist, and a God-fearing man who would preach at church, adding that what had happened was a result of the devil attacking him for doing the work of the Lord. Mokoena and Mantsoe are believed to have dated for seven months prior to her brutal death. â€“ News24
