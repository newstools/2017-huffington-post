The South African Taxi Industry in Gauteng brought the country to a stand-still as early as 3:30am on Thursday morning. The strike wass against a 28 percent interest fee they pay monthly on their vehicles and taxi drivers claim it is too much and took to the streets in the early hours of dawn. Taxi drivers claim their vehicles are being repossessed because of the interest fee and commuters are also finding it difficult because they cannot afford taxi. @Julius_S_Malema @EFFSouthAfrica leadership y r we not saying or doing anything about this.

Traffic authorities have urged motorists to be patient. Johannesburg Metro Police Department spokesperson Wayne Minnaar told News24 that taxis were blocking roads and travelling on the N1, N3 and N12. According to Minnaar, taxi drivers hijacked trucks to block the Allendale offramp. "This started at around 3am. I cannot confirm any injuries. I can confirm taxi drivers hijacked trucks to block the freeway at Allendale off ramp." N1 northbound at old Johannesburg split... massively backed up.
