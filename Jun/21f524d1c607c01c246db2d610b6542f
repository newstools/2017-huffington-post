During a phone call to congratulate recently-elected Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar on Tuesday, President Donald Trump managed to objectify a female reporter.In his conversation with Varadkar, Trump said, "We have a lot of your Irish press watching us right now," before gesturing for Irish reporter Caitriona Perry to come over to his desk."We have all of this Irish, beautiful Irish press," he said. "Where are you from? Come here, come here."Then, in front of everyone and still on the phone with the Prime Minister, he said: "She has a nice smile on her face, so I bet she treats you well."In a video tweeted by Perry after the incident, Perry is seen laughing nervously and moving away from Trump's desk.When Perry, who works as Washington Correspondent &amp; U.S. Bureau Chief with RT&Eacute; News-Ireland, tweeted the footage, she called the incident "bizarre."
