Ramadan is a time of fasting and spiritual purification. But another important aspect of the month begins after the sun sets, when families gather together to break the daily fast over a joyous evening meal called iftar.&nbsp;Home chefs often spend days planning elaborate iftar menus. Giving an iftar meal to a friend or another fasting Muslim is seen as a blessed act, so some chefs make it a point to invite others over for the meal, or to give food at a community center or mosque. &nbsp;Because of Islam&rsquo;s geographic spread, the iftar meal looks and tastes different for members of different cultures. In Indonesia, the country with the world&rsquo;s largest Muslim population, families might sit down to eat opor ayam, a chicken stew made with coconut milk, curry paste and lemongrass. For black Muslim families in America, a&nbsp;special treat for the evening could be&nbsp;bean pie.Below, HuffPost has compiled a list of Muslim foodies to follow during Ramadan.
