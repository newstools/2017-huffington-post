The Gauteng Metered Taxi Operators Committee (GMTCO) on Wednesday notified Gautrain management that it would march to its offices in Midrand to speak to its chief executive. Management at OR Tambo International Airport sent a press release on Thursday morning saying the group would gather at OR Tambo International and East Rand shopping malls at 9am, when they will march to the Gautrain's head office in Midrand. Routes expected to be affected include: Johannesburg Metro Police Department spokesperson Emma Mamonyane told eNCA on Thursday morning strikers did not approach them in time for permission to march. "They can't come today to say tomorrow this is what we want to do," she said. "They were turned down, but we sat down as law enforcement so that we care prepared," she said. Metered taxis have been increasingly frustrated with the inclusion of Uber and Taxify in South Africa without their consultation saying they felt the apps have taken their jobs.
