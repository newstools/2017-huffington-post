Rihanna isn&rsquo;t here for your body-shaming.&nbsp;On Monday, the &ldquo;Work&rdquo; singer posted a meme on Instagram that seemed to be a response to a Barstool Sports article published last week that asked, &ldquo;Is Rihanna Going To Make Being Fat the Hot New Trend?&rdquo;&nbsp;Clearly, RiRi was having none of it. The meme she shared features two images of rapper Gucci Mane at different weights.&ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t handle me at my 2007 Gucci Mane, you don&rsquo;t deserve me at my 2016 Gucci Mane,&rdquo; it reads. The singer accompanied the meme with a single-tear emoji.&nbsp;A post shared by badgalriri (@badgalriri) on Jun 5, 2017 at 11:02am PDTNailed it. In fact, we&rsquo;d go so far as to say that anyone who criticizes Rihanna&rsquo;s body at any point doesn&rsquo;t deserve her at all.The offending article has since been removed from Barstool&rsquo;s website for, essentially, not being funny enough. (Note: Body-shaming is never funny. How many times do we need to say this?)&nbsp;The article&rsquo;s author also took it upon himself to complain about others not liking his story, saying he was being &ldquo;cyberbullied.&rdquo;&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re gonna blog about Rihanna gaining weight you better be funny as f**k and you better make it bullet proof,&rdquo; Barstool Sports founder David Portnoy said in a statement. He noted that if he or one one of his other bloggers had written the story, he would &ldquo;defend it to the death.&rdquo;&nbsp;How about just never writing a story about Rihanna&rsquo;s or anyone else&rsquo;s body at all?&nbsp;Share this slide:
