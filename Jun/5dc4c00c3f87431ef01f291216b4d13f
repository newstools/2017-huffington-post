Piers Morgan has publicly apologised to Ariana Grande following comments he made about the US star after her concert was targeted by a suicide bomber last month. The &lsquo;Good Morning Britain&rsquo; presenter came under fire after he criticised the singer in the wake of the terrorist attack which killed 22 people. Piers took aim at the traumatised 23-year-old after she flew back to the US the day after the atrocity, suggesting she should have stayed in the UK and visited the survivors. But following Sunday&rsquo;s One Love Manchester concert, Piers took to Twitter to apologise, saying he had &ldquo;misjudged&rdquo; the star. He tweeted: &ldquo;I thought Ariana Grande was wrong to fly off after #Manchesterattacks. But tonight she&rsquo;s putting on a fabulous show.&rdquo; I thought Ariana Grande was wrong to fly off after #ManchesterAttack. But tonight she&#39;s putting on a fabulous show. #OneLoveManchester pic.twitter.com/h6TLStGeoRHe then added: &ldquo;I misjudged you, @ArianaGrande &amp; I apologise. You&rsquo;re an admirable young woman &amp; this is a magnificent night. Respect.&rdquo; I misjudged you, @ArianaGrande &amp; I apologise. You&#39;re an admirable young woman &amp; this is a magnificent night.

By far the best vocal performance tonight&hellip;&rdquo; he tweeted. I&#39;ll say this too about @ArianaGrande - she has a cracking voice.

Very rarely happens. https://t.co/nSIa4IPbHOSome of the biggest names in the music industry came together to honour the victims of the Manchester terror attack .
