AnalysisLike a drowning man clutching a straw, the ANC and its youth league need to gain back credibility from its youth amid all the revelations about state capture. What's a really good way to do this? To discredit the source of information ie. the media.The ANCYL held a media briefing at Luthuli House on Tuesday, supposedly to air their preferred candidates for the ANC presidential race.It endorsed Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma as their preferred outright candidate for presidency and threw shade on Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, saying 'there is nothing special about him".Collen Maine is asked why NDZ over Cyril. "There is nothing special about Cyril." pic.twitter.com/Z4iCfA751W#ANCYL: Here's Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma,our preferred candidate in the succession battle to replace Jacob Zuma as the President. pic.twitter.com/sikKpdAQcJDoubts were being cast on social media about whether the ANCYL reflects the concerns of young people anymore.Leadership of the dysfunctional #ANCYL ... why did these people call a presser bathong, he banna! pic.twitter.com/Z6K9v6QOruLadies and gentlemen, boys and girls, women and men, aunties and uncle, I present to you The leadership of the #ANCYL pic.twitter.com/lXobuPCj1RThe ANCYL also took shots at the media for most of the briefing and claimed the leaked Gupta emails were obtained illegally. ANCYL general secretary Njabulo Nzuza went on for the duration of the briefing saying the media were unaccountable and claimed the circulation of 'fake news'.#ANCYL media briefing was OK, saw journalists napping nyana, some where packing away their laptops... Until Nzuza fired shots @ the media. pic.twitter.com/a5tIfPFDqwNzuza is so funny shouting like a lunatic, delusional statements #ANCYL
