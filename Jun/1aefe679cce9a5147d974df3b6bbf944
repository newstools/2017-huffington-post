His shareholder-demanded departure is only the latest in a series of ousters and resignations at the company.&nbsp;In the last six months, the ride-hailing app has hemorrhaged high-ranking leaders as allegations of sexual harassment , a toxic workplace culture , corporate subterfuge and profiteering came to light and played out in viral social media campaigns and those are apparently just the tip of the iceberg. &nbsp; Kalanick&rsquo;s resignation doesn&rsquo;t come as a surprise -- after he was caught on video&nbsp;chewing out an Uber driver who questioned the company&rsquo;s compensation policies in February, even he admitted&nbsp;he needed &ldquo;leadership help.&rdquo; If the vacancies at the top of Uber&rsquo;s ranks indicate anything, the whole company needs it.
