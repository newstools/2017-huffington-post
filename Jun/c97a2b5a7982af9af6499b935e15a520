When media personality Nomzamo Mbatha took the international stage by storm earlier this month, we should have known she was onto something even bigger. Mbatha took to Twitter to announce on Friday morning that she would be co-hosting the Black Entertainment (BET) Awards alongside actress and model, Eva Marcille, come Sunday, June 25.  She said the news is yet to sink in. Media personalities Bonang Matheba and Terry Pheto also took to the social media platform to congratulate Mbatha.   The 27-year-old has been living it up in LA over the last week attending pre-parties and gala dinners all this while rubbing shoulders with the most.
