Johnny Dladla is Eskom's new acting CEO, and he is relatively unknown -- which is a good thing in the embattled parastatal plagued by allegations of fraud, corruption and mismanagement. A quick online news search of "Johnny Dladla" reveals no wrongdoings exposed in the media. Could a long-serving, controversy-free CEO be exactly what Eskom needs? Here is what you need to know about Dladla: Eskom board chairman Ben Ngubane resigned earlier this month under a cloud. Ngubane has been under the spotlight since former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela released her 'State of Capture' report implicating him in alleged improper dealings. Ngubane has been mentioned in the Gupta email leaks twice thus far. Also, Eskom's previous acting CEO Matshela Koko was suspended earlier this year after allegations of a possible conflict of interest involving his stepdaughterâ€š who was a director of a company that allegedly scored R1 billion in business from the parastatal.
