Travis Scott delivered one of the most breathtaking performances by an International act in South Africa. The dome was filled to its 20,000 capacity. The crowd was warmed up by South Africa's Cassper Nyovest and Riky Rick. La Flame performed most of his commercial hits and songs dating back to his mixtape days, as they crowd rapped along. If you missed it, we rounded up five of our favourite clips of his performance on Thursday night. 1. Butterfly Effect Scott's newly released single "Butterfly Effect" saw the Dome reach a crescendo.
