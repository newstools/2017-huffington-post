And she knows it.A post shared by MzansiMagic (@mzansimagic) on May 13, 2017 at 5:30am PDTIn Thursday night's episode, because she had flu, MaCele bowed out of the traditional ceremony because impepho was too much for her to handle. And in last week's episode, she almost tore at wife number three, MaKhumalo, for expressing an opinion different to hers.And if snippets of next week's episode are anything to go by, it's truly about to be lit. At a party thrown to appreciate her, MaCele says: "He can take more wives today because I know he won't treat me any differently." When the show made its debut a few weeks ago, Musa Mseleku told HuffPost SA, "All my wives are human. What you will see will not be staged, just our life." And she's pretty superhuman.
