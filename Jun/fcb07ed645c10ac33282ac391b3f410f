SA rapper Nadia Nakai was on Factory 78, a UK radio station, as she gave us her Bragga Freestyle. With bars being the essential part of freestyling in hip-hop, Nadia Nakai needed "the keys, the keys, the keys" necessary to unlock possibly one of the most hilariously, awkward and below-par freestyles we've seen. #BraggaFreestyle 'BARS' pic.twitter.com/XDiAC4UXjk  We know, freestyling is a skill not many rappers can perfect, but after her Bragga Freestyle went online, SA Twitter was not impressed at all.  #BraggaFreestyle
Nadia : the keys the keys the keys the keys.....
