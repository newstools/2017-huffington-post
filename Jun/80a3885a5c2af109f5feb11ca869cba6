The actress said she considered Shakur one of her best friends, saying in an undated interview, &ldquo;he was like a brother.&rdquo;In a series of tweets posted Friday afternoon, Pinkett Smith called out &ldquo;All Eyez on Me&rdquo;&nbsp;for its inaccuracies.&ldquo;Forgive me ... my relationship to Pac is too precious to me for the scenes in All Eyez On Me to stand as truth,&rdquo; she began, noting that the specific scene (watch it above)&nbsp;in which the &ldquo;California Love&rdquo; rapper reads her a poem didn&rsquo;t happen in real life.&nbsp;&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know that poem existed until it was printed in his book,&rdquo; Pinkett Smith wrote, continuing with a few more clarifications before saying, &ldquo;the reimagining of my relationship to Pac has been deeply hurtful.&rdquo;Forgive me... my relationship to Pac is too precious to me for the scenes in All Eyez On Me to stand as truth.Pac never read me that poem. I didn&#39;t know that poem existed until it was printed in his book.Pac never said goodbye to me before leaving for LA. He had to leave abruptly and it wasn&#39;t to pursue his career.I&#39;ve never been to any of Pac&#39;s shows by his request.
