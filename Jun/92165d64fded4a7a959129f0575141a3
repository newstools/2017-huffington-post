A man was reportedly tasered outside the Houses of Parliament on Thursday amid claims he may have been armed with a knife. Pictures on social media show the man being restrained by armed officers shortly before 11.30am. "There were shouts of 'knife, knife, knife' and man was brought down with a Taser," Evening Standard reporter Joe Murphy wrote on Twitter.
