Wayde van Niekerk made history again on Wednesday at the IAAF Athletics meeting, when he broke the 300m world's best, clocking in at 30.81 in Ostrava, Czech Republic. It is now the second time that Wayde has broken a record - which was previously held by USA's Micheal Johnson, after beating his record at the 2016 Rio Olympics and again in the 300m, yes the 300m. IAAF The Little Run 300m300m races in track events are seldom-run, it is an unusual race the tests speed, stamina and resilience. The 300m dash is a mixture of the long-distance running, like the 400m and requires the speed of a sprint runner, like the 200m. Ironically, The Little Run 300m, as it title may suggest, is far from little, it is draining and excruciating discipline.The 300m is an informal division since it is ratified there is no 'world-record' but rather 'worlds-best' and it is a race that could be used to aid a 200m runner's stamina or a 400 m runner's speed. You need to find the balance in your strategy when running the 300, and with this exclusive race rarely ran, athletes may find it difficult training and running the 300.Here is an illustration of The Little Run 300m mark.
