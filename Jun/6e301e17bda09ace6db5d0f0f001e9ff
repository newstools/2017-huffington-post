Last night, as people fled London Bridge and the surrounding area, one man became an unlikely hero - quite possibly without even realising. Howard Manella tweeted a photo of people running from the attackers. One of the men pictured fleeing the scene was still clutching his beer, trying not to spill it. The unknown man's actions have proven relatable for many Londoners. "People fleeing London Bridge but the bloke on the right isn't spilling a drop," tweeted Howard Mannella. "God Bless the Brits!" While some were disappointed that jokes were being made so soon after the attack, others said they were glad to see the British sense of humour shining through in such dark times. @Albilicueta true British style! This is what makes us great Let's get our priorities right! We are British after all. Reacting to hate with humor. Well done Brits. üëçMourn and remember the victims, but don't change.  Others were quick to add their own slice of wit to the mix. It's London bridge ffs he's paid ¬£5.50 for that pint When you're fleeing terror, but you don't wanna spill your pint. #LoveLondon#LondonAttacks

Tally ho" Seven people were killed and at least 48 injured in the terror attack which took place at London Bridge and Borough Market. Three male attackers were shot and killed within eight minutes of the first call to emergency services. Police believe they have killed all the attackers involved with the incident.
