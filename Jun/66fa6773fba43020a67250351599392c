The Divine Miss M just made personal Tonys history.Bette Midler, star of the Broadway revival of &ldquo;Hello, Dolly!,&rdquo; won her first competitive Tony award on Sunday night, taking home the statuette for Best Actress in a Musical. She&rsquo;d previously won a special (non-competitive) award in 1974 for &ldquo;adding lustre to the Broadway season,&rdquo; but, at 71, she finally nabbed the recognition she deserved.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so privileged. I&rsquo;m so honored,&rdquo; she said as she accepted her award. &ldquo;I hope I don&rsquo;t cry,&rdquo; she added, before joking about dating most of the Tony voters.Watch @BetteMidler&#39;s (amazing) #TonyAwards acceptance speech https://t.co/IzCPrnZDhI pic.twitter.com/dkxNzM69zwMidler&rsquo;s speech was probably one of the longest of the night the orchestra attempted to play her off, but she continued speaking, outlasting the musical crescendo. &ldquo;Shut that crap off,&rdquo; she yelled at one point.&ldquo;Revival is an interesting word,&rdquo; she could be heard saying when the music stopped. &ldquo;It means &lsquo;near death.&rsquo;&rdquo;She wrapped up by telling audiences that&nbsp;&ldquo;Hello, Dolly!&rdquo; had never really gone away, encouraging everyone to see the classic show.Born in 1945, Midler made her Broadway debut in &ldquo;Fiddler on the Roof&rdquo; in 1964. Throughout out her decadeslong career in show business,&nbsp;the singer-songwriter-actor-comedian won several Grammys and Emmys, leaving her one letter away from the coveted EGOT designation. She&rsquo;s been twice-nominated for an Oscar for her roles in &ldquo;The Rose&rdquo; and &ldquo;For the Boys,&rdquo; but has yet to secure an Academy Award.In fact, in 1979, Midler lost an Oscar to &ldquo;Norma Rae&rdquo; actress Sally Field, who, this year,&nbsp;was also nominated for a Tony for Best Actress in a Play for her role in&nbsp;&ldquo;The Glass Menagerie.&rdquo; But Field lost the award to&rdquo;A Doll&rsquo;s House, Part 2&rdquo; actress Laurie Metcalf. So ... what goes around, comes around?&ldquo;Hello, Dolly!,&rdquo; based on Thornton Wilder&rsquo;s 1938 play &ldquo;The Merchant of Yonkers,&rdquo;&nbsp;was famously adapted into a movie starring Barbra Streisand. It tells the story of a matchmaker, Dolly Levi played by Midler in the 2017 production a professional meddler who falls for a &ldquo;client,&rdquo; the grumpy near-millionaire Horace Vandergelder.&nbsp;Check out more of the 2017 Tony Award winners here.
