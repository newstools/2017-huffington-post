Rehabilitation? nah fam &zwj; Just look at South African government. Entertaining inmates with strippers. #PrisonStrippers pic.twitter.com/WT6d8vjPSxClearly prison in South Africa is an all expenses paid holiday on an exotic island and not a place of rehabilitation. #PrisonStrippersSome taxpayers felt injustice from government when they saw the treatment of prisoners and were livid.A country that allows strippers to entertain inmates in prison. Why won't crime be on a high in South Africa. Shame. #PrisonStrippers pic.twitter.com/FfvpRZBDdMSome citizens found the incident humorous.#PrisonStrippers pic.twitter.com/tmDnB5vXicNext time prisoners will burn the prison when denied their "Basic right" to strip shows.
