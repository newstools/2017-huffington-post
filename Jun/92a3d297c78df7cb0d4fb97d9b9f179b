We’re seriously in love with the shape of Ed Sheeran’s “Carpool Karaoke.” The British pop star’s skit on the “Late Late Show” aired Tuesday and it didn’t disappoint. Joined by host James Corden, Sheeran sang some of his biggest hits before covering Justin Bieber’s “Love Yourself,” which he actually penned himself. In between songs, Sheeran revealed why he doesn’t have a cell phone anymore, why he feels more comfortable while holding a guitar and why he was super nervous about doing the segment in the first place. He also recalled an unusual game of golf with Bieber before defeating Corden in a hilarious confectionary competition:  Check out the full segment above.
