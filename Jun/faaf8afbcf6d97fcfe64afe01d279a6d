While South Africa's attention has been diverted by the recent revelations on state capture, ANC presidential hopeful Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma has quietly been going about her business, blazing her campaign trail across the country. In April, it seemed Dlamini-Zuma was in the process of finding her feet, making only a few public appearances the entire month. She spoke at the Solomon Mahlangu Lecture in Tshwane on April 6 and, a week later, addressed the Cadres Assembly of the African National Congress (ANC) in the Free State. On April 20, she headed to KwaZulu-Natal to deliver a keynote address on free education at the Durban University of Technology. It did not take her long to kick it up a gear.   May was an extremely busy period for the former African Union chairperson, with the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal provinces seemingly her main areas of focus.

The league has become one of her strongest allies. Dlamini-Zuma headed to Limpopo on May 20 to address the ANC Youth League, which is another of her big backers for the country's top spot. Two days later, she kicked off her Eastern Cape crusade. It was a four-day, back-to-back sprint in her first return to the province since February, when Xhosa King Mpendulo Zwelonke Sigcawu rejected her, saying the country is not ready for a female president. Dlamini-Zuma has kept out of the public domain so far this month. She is said to be in Denmark after she was nominated to receive the Africa Energy Forum's lifetime achievement award, but this could not be confirmed.
