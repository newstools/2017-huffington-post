Spokespeople for Bill Cosby and his wife, Camille, appeared on &ldquo;Good Day Alabama&rdquo; on Wednesday and said they will be holding an upcoming series of town halls to educate the public on sexual assault.&nbsp;Andrew Wyatt and Ebonee Benson discussed the recent mistrial of Cosby&rsquo;s case&nbsp;and explained what&rsquo;s next for the Cosby camp. Wyatt vaguely discussed what sounds to be a town hall tour around the country.&nbsp;While it&rsquo;s unclear if Cosby himself will be on the tour, Wyatt told &ldquo;Good Day Alabama&rdquo; that the town halls will be a space to talk to young people about sexual assault.&ldquo;We are now planning town halls and we&rsquo;re gonna be coming to this city sometime in July,&rdquo; Wyatt said. &ldquo;To talk to young people because this is bigger than Bill Cosby. This issue can affect any young person, especially young athletes of today. And they need to know what they&rsquo;re facing when they&rsquo;re hanging out and partying, when they&rsquo;re doing certain things that they shouldn&rsquo;t be doing &mdash; and it also affects married men.&rdquo;Wyatt added that there will be a town hall in Montgomery, Alabama &ldquo;sometime in July.&rdquo;When the host of &ldquo;Good Day Alabama&rdquo; retorted that these town halls are &ldquo;kind of a do as I say not as I do situation,&rdquo; Benson interjected, explaining that people need to be educated on sexual assault legislation.&nbsp;&ldquo;Laws are changing. The statute of limitations for victims of sexual assault are being extended,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;So, this is why people need to be educated on a brush against the shoulder, you know anything at this point can be considered sexual assault and it&rsquo;s a good thing to be educated about the laws.&rdquo;&nbsp;Watch the full &ldquo;Good Day Alabama&rdquo; interview below.&nbsp;While it&rsquo;s still unclear what the town halls will consist of, it sounds as though Cosby&rsquo;s camp will be holding these events to teach people how to avoid being accused of sex crimes. HuffPost reached out to Cosby&rsquo;s spokespeople for clarification, but had not heard back by the time of publication.&nbsp;In response to the interview, women&rsquo;s advocacy group UltraViolet had this to say:&nbsp;&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s call this tour what it really is: Bill Cosby&rsquo;s &lsquo;how to get away with rape and sexual assault&rsquo; tour.&nbsp; The fact that Cosby, a man who has admitted to drugging women with quaaludes, would have the audacity to travel the country teaching men how to avoid rape accusations is a disgusting display of rape culture in action.&rdquo;After 52 hours of deliberation, jurors on Cosby&rsquo;s criminal case were unable to reach a unanimous decision and were forced to declare a mistrial. The 79-year-old comedian was on trial for allegedly drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand, a former women&rsquo;s basketball coach at Temple University, in 2004. On Saturday, Montgomery County District Attorney Kevin R. Steele said he planned to retry the case.&nbsp;&nbsp;
