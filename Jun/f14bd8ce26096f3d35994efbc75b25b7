A man returned to his workplace months after being fired and shot five before turning his gun on himself, police said Monday. The subject, a 45-year-old "disgruntled employee," entered Fiamma Incorporated, an Orlando, Florida, company that makes RV accessories, around 8:03 a.m. local time with a handgun and a knife, Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said in a news conference. The man shot and killed three men and one woman. A fifth man later died of his injuries at a local hospital. Seven people were injured. The subject was fired sometime in April of this year, Demings said. He had a criminal history "minor in nature," including marijuana possession and a DUI. He reportedly battered a fellow Fiamma employee in 2014, Demings said, but this person was not present during Monday's shooting. "It appears that this incident has nothing to do with any global terror activities," the sheriff said. Orlando has been preparing to mark the one-year anniversary of the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history, which took place at the city's Pulse nightclub.
