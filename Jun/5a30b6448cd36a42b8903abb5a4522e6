Comedian Bill Maher dropped a racial slur in a joke Friday on “Real Time,” and people erupted on social media. While discussing the state of Nebraska, his guest, Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), told Maher, “We’d love to have you work in the fields with us.” Apparently confused by the invitation, Maher joked “Work in the fields? Senator, I’m a house n****r!” Sasse looked uncomfortable, and the audience reacted with a mix of claps and groans. Then Maher, a critic of political correctness, followed up his remark by pointing out the sarcasm. “No, it’s a joke,” he said. The “Real Time” audience seemed to quickly forgive the host with a round of applause. Waving off the reaction with his hand, Maher replied, “Thank you.” People on Twitter, however, weren’t so forgiving. His fans reminded Maher that the word is completely off-limits to him and any person who isn’t black ― even if the comedian rejects PC policing. Some are comparing Maher’s joke with Kathy Griffin’s shocking photo shoot of her holding a likeness of Trump’s bloody severed head, which outraged conservatives and liberals alike. @billmaher jokes have limits. high level of carelessness & indifference is destructive. Notice how Kathy Griffin self-destroyed! Others are recalling how Maher has previously faced accusations of Islamophobia and was criticized for “normalizing” alt-right troll Milo Yiannopoulos when interviewing him on his show in February. People shocked at Bill Maher being racist-y, check w your Arab & Muslim friends. Been doing this for a LONG time, but he got hall passes. Remember when Bill Maher had Milo on? & Milo disrespected the 2 black guests, @larrywilmore and @MalcolmNance. Remember how quiet Bill was?🤔 Sasse later revealed on Twitter that he wished he’d held Maher to account over the comment at the time, and admitted that “cringing last night wasn’t good enough.” Am walking off a redeye from LAX.3 reflections on @billmaher1. I’m a 1st Amendment absolutist. Comedians get latitude to cross hard lines. 2. But free speech comes with a responsibility to speak up when folks use that word. Me just cringing last night wasn’t good enough.(2of4?) https://t.co/e4Bw8s8tV2 3. Here’s what I wish I’d been quick enough to say in the moment: “Hold up, why would you think it’s OK to use that word?...(3of4?) https://t.co/mQL6wMEd7W (4of4)"...The history of the n-word is an attack on universal human dignity. It’s therefore an attack on the American Creed. Don't use it.” https://t.co/kEZm5vPFHK Maher hasn’t responded to the outrage yet, and, if he does, it probably won’t be an apology. The comedian, whose career hinges off his no-holds-barred sarcasm, believes that PC culture has become a dangerous vehicle in today’s politics and has warned Democrats to “ease up on the identity politics.” He’s even blamed PC culture for President Donald Trump’s win. But if people are wondering if it’s OK for Maher to casually drop the slur as a joke, we’ll let the Twitter outrage answer that question. Just watched the Bill Maher clip. pic.twitter.com/wDcENLICKA This article has been updated to include Sasse’s reaction to Maher’s comment and background on the comedian’s previous controversies.
