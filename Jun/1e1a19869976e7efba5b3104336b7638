Shawn JAY-Z Carter dropped his much anticipated 13th studio album titled 4:44 in the early hours of Friday. The album release comes four years after his previous release in 2013, with his commercial Magna Carter Holy Grail. 4:44 Tracklist: JAY-Z talks about insecurities and vulnerabilities in this album in a way you have never seen before, more especially his relationship with his wife, Beyoncé. He talks the about issues addressed by Beyoncé on "Lemonade" and opens up about cheating ways and taking Beyonce for granted. Here is an extract from the song 4:44: In the song -- in fact, in the whole album -- he discusses being a bad husband and the possibly of cheating on Beyoncé. Realising that these were the exact issues raised by Beyoncé in "Lemonade", the Beyhive tweeted up a storm when they connected the dots.     Jay Z really did cheat on Beyoncé. Lemonade wasn't a lie, BEYONCÉ WAS GOING THROUGH IT ALL. pic.twitter.com/oxMJYFPr8H
