Uber board of directors member David Bonderman has resigned after making a sexist crack about his female colleagues at a Tuesday meeting on the company&rsquo;s plans to address complaints of sexism and other workplace culture problems.New York Times reporter Mike Isaac was first to report the news of the resignation,&nbsp;citing two people with knowledge of the decision.Bonderman faced criticism Tuesday after an exchange with fellow board member Arianna Huffington, the former editor-in-chief of HuffPost, during a company employee meeting. Huffington confirmed the resignation.Audio from the conversation obtained by Yahoo&nbsp;documented Huffington speaking about bringing Nestle executive Wan Ling Martello onto the board, saying data showed that having women in such positions was a way to increase the hiring of females.&nbsp;&ldquo;Actually, what it shows is that it&rsquo;s much more likely to be more talking,&rdquo; Bonderman replied.&nbsp;In the audio, Huffington laughs politely, saying, &ldquo;Oh, come on, David.&rdquo;Addressing the group, she then says, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, David will have a lot of talking to do as well,&rdquo; before moving on to a new topic.So...

He is the chairman and co-founder of TPG Capital, a major private-equity investment firm.&ldquo;I want to apologize to my fellow board member for a disrespectful comment that was directed at her during today&rsquo;s discussion,&rdquo; Bonderman wrote. &ldquo;It was inappropriate. I also want to apologize to all Uber employees who were offended by the remark. I deeply regret it.&rdquo;Huffington acknowledged Bonderman&rsquo;s apology in a statement provided to HuffPost.&nbsp;&rdquo;David has apologized to all Uber employees for a remark that was totally inappropriate and against the new culture we are building at Uber,&rdquo;&nbsp;she said.The incident occurred the same day embattled Uber CEO Travis Kalanick announced he would be taking a leave of absence to grieve for his mother, who died in a boating accident last month.At the meeting, company officials pledged to adopt the recommendations of a scathing report on its practices following intense criticism of its workplace culture. The company began the independent investigation process in February after former Uber engineer Susan Fowler published a blog post alleging discrimination and sexual harassment.&nbsp;Chief Human Resources Officer Liane Hornsey said on Tuesday that the company was committed to rebuilding trust but that &ldquo;change does not happen overnight.&rdquo;&ldquo;Implementing these recommendations will improve our culture, promote fairness and accountability, and establish processes and systems to ensure the mistakes of the past will not be repeated,&rdquo; Hornsey said in a statement.Ryan Grenoble contributed reporting.
