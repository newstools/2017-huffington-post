Jay Z became the first rapper to be inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame on Thursday night and he got one heck of an introduction.&nbsp;Former President Barack Obama delivered a videotaped message heaping praise on the music mogul, whose real name is Shawn Carter.&nbsp;Obama first congratulated many of the other inductees, including Kenneth &ldquo;Babyface&rdquo; Edmonds, Berry Gordy,&nbsp;Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis,&nbsp;Robert Lamm and James Pankow and Max Martin.&nbsp;Then he got to Jay Z.&ldquo;I like to think Mr. Carter and I understand each other. Nobody who met us as younger men would have expected us to be where we are today. We know what it&rsquo;s like not to have a father around, we know what it&rsquo;s like not to come from much, and to know people who didn&rsquo;t get the same breaks that we did. And so we try to prop open those doors of opportunity so that it&rsquo;s a little easier for those who come up behind us to succeed as well.&rdquo;The former commander in chief also made a crack referencing to their powerful partners, former first lady Michelle Obama and megastar singer Beyonc&eacute;.&nbsp;&ldquo;And let&rsquo;s face it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We both have wives who are significantly more popular than we are.&rdquo;&nbsp;Obama also spoke of listening to Jay Z&rsquo;s music throughout his career, from his early days as a state senator to preparing his final State of the Union address.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty sure I&rsquo;m still the only president to listen to Jay Z&rsquo;s music in the Oval Office,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;&ldquo;That may change at some point, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure that&rsquo;s true now.&rdquo;Check out the full message above.&nbsp;Jay Z proved he could give as well as he receives. While he wasn&rsquo;t at the ceremony Beyonc&eacute; is expected to&nbsp;give birth to their twins any day now&nbsp; he tweeted his thanks to&nbsp;&ldquo;all the people that have inspired me.&rdquo;The rap star wasn&rsquo;t sparing with the praise, either: He thanked some 90 other artists including&nbsp;The Notorious B.I.G., Tupac Shakur, Andre 3000, Nas,&nbsp;Lil Wayne, Queen Latifah&nbsp;and, of course,&nbsp;Queen Bey.&ldquo;B a rapper too!&rdquo; he wrote.&nbsp;But Jay Z saved his best praise for a man he called &ldquo;the greatest rapper of all time.&rdquo;&nbsp;&ldquo;Thank you 44,&rdquo; he wrote to Obama.&nbsp;&nbsp;Share this slide:
