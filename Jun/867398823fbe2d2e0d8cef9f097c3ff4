Armpit tattoos are taking over our social media feeds. From watercolour poppies to delicate roses, people have been sharing their new inkings with the world. UK-based tattoo artist Kevin Paul - who’s inked celebrities such as Ed Sheeran and Harry Styles - answered all our questions about this trend: “Yes, you can still shave as normal.” “Armpits can be one of the most painful places, as we have a lot of nerves running through there.” “I personally think it’s more men I have had come in asking for armpit tattoos, but they are getting more common.” “I have always found aftercare for armpits seems to be the easiest to look after as most of them seem to heal within days.” For some inspiration, here are a few of our favourites on Pinterest and Instagram: A post shared by Mojito Tattoo (@mojitotattoo) on May 25, 2017 at 10:58pm PDT A post shared by Shibby Thomas (@shibby_thomas) on Dec 9, 2016 at 9:57am PST A post shared by Ayrton Sickbird (@ayrton_sickbird) on Jun 4, 2017 at 8:56am PDT A post shared by Lisa Lisa Lisa (@lisalivewire430) on Sep 12, 2016 at 4:17am PDT A post shared by Parloir (@parloiruk) on May 21, 2017 at 3:08am PDT A post shared by 🌸Tattoo & Art 🌸 (@marianrivers_tattoo) on Jun 8, 2017 at 4:29am PDT A post shared by Tom (@mynameisthomasgibbs) on Jun 10, 2017 at 8:57am PDT A post shared by Marie Scherping (@scherptagram) on Mar 22, 2017 at 8:36pm PDT (H/T: Elle UK)
