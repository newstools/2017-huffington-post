EFF leader Julius Malema has said the leaked Gupta leaks implicate government officials at the highest level, including Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba against whom he said the party would be laying criminal charges. Malema also distributed documents alleging corruption at Transnet at a press conference on Thursday, and called for citizens to take to the streets to protest against state capture. Malema: Emails are real. Authenticity is no longer an issue. We want people to go to the streets, don't wait for EFF. @HuffPostSA  Thousands of emails between the Guptas and their associates were leaked two weeks ago to various media houses, and allege the family sought to influence officials from government and state-owned companies.
