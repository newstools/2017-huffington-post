Bonang is getting her on emojis and she's calling them Bmojis! The businesswoman, presenter and all-round woman slayer made the announcement on social media on Wednesday night. Bmoji's.... a Bonang Matheba Entertainment Exclusive... July 2017!! 👑 pic.twitter.com/1PNeXmyc5Z Just imagine a world where your reactions are basically Bonang's expressions.  All we're hoping for is some flashback Bonang too, man. We're already having the most fun with gifs thanks to GifsForSA by Lelo Macheke. How do you say "I don't know" in Bonang?  How do you say "come through" in Bonang?  And how about: "Actually, I am bored!"  In fact, people have already started to use the Bmojis to illustrate their feelings and actions, and the queen herself retweeted all the praise. It's the Durban July this weekend and you know people will be burning money fast.
