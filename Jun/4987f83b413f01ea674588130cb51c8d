Tom Hanks is used to perplexing his fans on Twitter. The Hollywood star regularly posts photographs of random lost gloves and other items of clothing that he spots discarded on the street. On Friday, however, he freaked out many of his 13 million followers with this snap of a building in New York City: "This is the scariest building I've ever seen," wrote Hanks of the windowless edifice. "WTF goes on inside??" His question prompted plenty of speculation: That's clearly the ministry of truth as described by George Orwell in 1984 pic.twitter.com/Y3Ksw06n3c It's where they make TV remotes that don't work The national covfefe center It's a hotel with only inside rooms. They make crotchet penguins.... World Jenga championships.... scary stuff ðŸ˜‰ x Amid the lighthearted suggestions, however, some fans actually attempted to answer Hanks factually. While the building at 33 Thomas Street in Lower Manhattan is technically owned and occupied by AT&T and Verizon, it's reportedly used as the National Security Agency's spy hub. Reported to be NSA, @tomhanks. No kidding, see https://t.co/MuPnvjEjnI Spies https://t.co/MZgjEIj0U0 So now Hanks knows.
