You should know by now that Ntando Duma and Junior Mzizi, known popularly as Junior De Rocka, are expecting a baby girl. Her name is Sbahle Mzizi and she is expected to arrive soon. You should care about this because even before she is born, Sbahle seems to have accomplished what most of us can only wish for -- baby girl has over 32,500 followers on Instagram. Sbahle, which loosely translated from isiZulu means "we are beautiful", is described in the bio as "daddy's fav girl, mommy's little princess" Her bio also says she is a future president. But her account, which holds 38 posts at the time of publishing, is private. Sbahle joins the likes of five-month-old Shaka Madida, who has over 13,000 followers. Shaka is the son of musicians Nandi and Zakhele Madida.
