Actress, celebrity chef and judge on Mzansi Magic's cooking reality show, KFC Taste Kitchen, Lucia Mthiyane, says she can tell if food was not prepared with love. Speaking to HuffPost SA, Mthiyane said contrary to people's perceptions that she is tough on contestants in the show, she is actually just firm. "The prize money for the show is R1 million and so we cannot play around. We have to be firm and brutally honest. If we show too much kindness people will just slack and be lazy," Mthiyane said. Don't forget to tune in tonight 7 pm Mzansi Magic...#KFCTASTEKITCHEN..it's a date  She said although the cooking industry is male dominated, black women wanting to follow in her footsteps should be brave and forge on. "If you're passionate about your food, you will do your research and know your stuff. Also, spend time practising your trade and be focused and patient. Nothing is impossible," Mthiyane said. Mthiyane who starred on etv's Rhythm City over 10 years ago, said she's not keen to go back to acting on a full-time basis if it will interfere with her food journey. KFC Taste Kitchen is currently on its eighth episode. It airs on Fridays at 7pm. Mthiyane judges the show alongside chef Lentswe Bhengu while Media personality Bonang Matheba presents the show. 11 HOURS LEFT till the debut of South Africa's biggest cooking competition 'Taste Kitchen' âž¡ @mzansimagic ðŸ˜ŽðŸŽ¥ #cooking #chef #judge #television  Asked what her future looks like, Mthiyane said she is in a good space as far as her career is concerned and is enjoying doing what she loves. "The future looks so bright I'd need to put on my sunglasses to describe it. I'm going at my own pace and loving every moment," Mthiyane said.
