ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe said candidates in the running to lead the governing party should play fair and refrain from being assisted by the state. "They must contest on the basis of logic on what they are going to do and on the values of the ANC..." Mantashe was speaking to Bongani Bingwa on Talk Radio 702's breakfast show on Wednesday morning. When Bingwa asked whether he was insinuating that "fingers can be pointed to the Union buildings" , Mantashe said he would not be talking about the matter any further. Mantsahe is the second member of the governing party who has spoken out about state resources being used to further people's own political agendas. According to The Citizen, Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa spoke out about the same issue after he made headlines for allegedly having affairs with a number of women. At the weekend, Ramaphosa attempted to interdict Sunday Independent from publishing claims of emails allegedly showing his communication with a string of women. Judge Bashier Vally, in his judgment, said that Ramaphosa had not placed sufficient information before the court to show that the matter was urgent and subsequently struck it from the roll. "We now need to confront the likelihood that state agencies and resources are being abused to promote factional political agendas," Ramaphosa said after the story had been published. Ramaphosa said the revelations were similar to the "Stratkom" disinformation campaigns of the apartheid era. He added: "This operation appears to have access to resources within intelligence circles with the capability to intercept communications and hack private emails."
