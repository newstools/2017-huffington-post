Business is booming for owner-run bed-and-breakfasts in the township of Khayelitsha in the Western Cape, according to the provincial economic opportunities, tourism, economic development and agriculture department. Airbnb's regional market consultant for southern Africa, Velma Corcoran, said at a press launch that Airbnb's move to the township would boost even further trade. "Through hosting on Airbnb, members of the Khayelitsha community can become part of the tourism economy. This will directly impact their lives, but also benefit the wider community, local business and shops. Airbnb can help unlock diverse communities that weren't as accessible to visitors before." Here are two of our favourite Khayelitsha listings on Airbnb: Lungi's Township B&B "How safe is sleeping in the middle of the township? What you hear about townships might only be the negative stories. But, in general, this area of Khayelitsha is safe and there is a lot of social control by the local community. During the evenings, men from the neighbourhood committee make sure the bed-and-breakfast area is secure and safe. "Since Lungi's B&B opened its doors, no incidents have happened and we are proud to say that all our guests tell us that they really feel safe while staying with Gladys and her family," Lungi's BnB says on Airbnb. Malebo's B&B 
"Experience Khayelitsha township and Xhosa culture in our locally owned B&B 30 minutes from Cape Town. We have been hosting travellers in our home for more than 16 years. We have five comfortable, renovated rooms. Xhosa cuisine is my speciality!"
