The emails are communications with various women. The Sunday Independent alleges these contain the details of the romantic and sexual liaisons of Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa. He has said they contain details of bursars whom he and his wife support.Yes. Ramaphosa did not allege either in his public statements nor in his court papers seeking to interdict Sunday Independent from publishing the emails that they were fake. The authenticity of the emails does not appear to be in doubt.It does appear that two of Ramaphosa's private Gmail accounts were hacked. The deputy president suggested in his statement on Saturday that this was part of a dirty tricks operation to prevent the push back against state capture. Ramaphosa is running an anti-corruption campaign.Ramaphosa is married to Dr. Tshepo Motsepe. She is an exceptional person. Not given to the limelight, Motsepe is a quietly elegant person. No doubt she will not enjoy the next period, but she is unlikely to leave her husband. Similarly, her sister, Bridgette Radebe, did not leave her husband Minister of Performance Monitoring and Evaluation Jeff Radebe after his mini sex scandal earlier this year.The jury's out on whether or not he will take the crown at the ANC conference in December. But that has almost nothing to do with this sex scandal. Instead, that win depends on how he is doing at wooing the branches of the ANC and getting their nominations as ANC president. Those nominations opened this week which explains why the leaks happened now.
