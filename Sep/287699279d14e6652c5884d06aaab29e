The managing director of Auto Suppliers, Lance O'Leary, has been suspended following a road-rage incident that was caught on camera, according to Times Live.The video shows O'Leary, who was driving a Porsche, aggressively kicking and punching the door of a Range Rover. It is believed the driver of the Range Rover collided with his vehicle."I'm going to find you, motherf****r," he said as he went on a vicious attack.Auto Suppliers issued a statement on Thursday afternoon saying the decision to suspend him was taken after it saw the video, which went viral on social media."As a company with a solid reputation that is 12 years in the making we pride ourselves on the way we do business," the management team said."This incident is by no means a reflection of our moral code, nor does it represent a change in our business ethics."[Although] property was damaged O'Leary did not physically assault the driver," Auto Supplies said. "The incident on camera was precipitated by a car accident where the Range Rover fled the scene of the accident after maliciously damaging O'Leary's vehicle. The damage from this accident amounted to R100,000.""I am consulting my attorney and will release a statement [on Friday],'' O'Leary told Times Live.Read: VIDEO: You Won't Believe How This Paarl Road-Rage Incident Ended
