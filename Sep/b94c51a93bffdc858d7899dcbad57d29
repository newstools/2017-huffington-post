A video apparently showing bodyguards of a KwaZulu-Natal ANC leader -- showing off high-calibre firearms and making death threats -- has emerged. eNCA is reporting that the men are bodyguards of ANC eThekwini regional secretary, Bheki Ntuli. "We'll kill this dog today. It's going down today," one of them said. In the video, the men can be heard making death threats while cocking an AK-47, which is illegal to carry in South Africa. It is unclear who they are threatening. The video comes amid a scourge of political killings that have plagued the KwaZulu-Natal province, with AK-47s used in many of the assassinations.
