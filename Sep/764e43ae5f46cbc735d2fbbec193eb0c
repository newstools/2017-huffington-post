EFF leader Julius Malema did not get his honours degree in philosophy by musing on the works of Socrates or Plato. Instead, the fiery politician focused on what he does best: politics. Malema's thesis was on the role of Afrikaans in maintaining white supremacy, reports Netwerk24. The Unisa degree was bestowed on Malema on Wednesday evening. Malema said his research was not aimed at people who speak the language. Rather, he said he believed that Afrikaans was being used to perpetuate white supremacy in South Africa. But his studies weren't always easy, Juju admitted. "I had to make many changes in my life to accommodate my studies," he said after the graduation ceremony. The ceremony was attended by many of Malema's EFF colleagues, family members and even his gran, Sarah.
