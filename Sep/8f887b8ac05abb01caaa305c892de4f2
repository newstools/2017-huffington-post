In his first speech before the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday, U.S President Donald Trump spoke for 41 minutes on a number of controversial topics, at one point threatening to "totally destroy" North Korea. Zimbabwe.....we know. pic.twitter.com/hyzIkX8vJ0 But members of the Zimbabwean delegation, including President Robert Mugabe, seemed far from interested. A widely shared image appears to show the 93-year-old leader falling asleep in his seat. Here are 5 things our world politicians can do to stay awake. 1. Drink Coffee, A Lot Of Coffee Politicians often spend hours in Parliament talking about world issues, and at times it can get tiring. So unless you want to avoid the EFF's Mbuyiseni Ndlozi calling you out for sleeping, perhaps you should consider waking up to coffee -- a lot of it. Wake up and smell the coffee...  2. Go To Bed Early What do our politicians get up to after hours? If politicians can't stay awake in Parliament, it must mean they are not getting the required eight hours sleep. If you are going to a United Nations conference or attending parly in South Africa, it would be prudent to get a good night's rest.  3. Take Naps, But Not At Work Don't underestimate the power of a quality nap -- a nap is almost like a quick hibernation where you can gather your energy again and get to work. If push comes to shove, when you do take naps at work, make sure you play it cool. Like this guy...  4. Snacks, Sweets and Energy Is it a crime to sneak in snacks and energy bars into parliament and conferences? Our world leaders may be senior statesmen, but that doesn't mean they can't have energy bars and snacks to give them a little kick.  5. Stand Up and Move If you are feeling sleepy, take notes from high school learners who stand up and ask the teacher to go to the toilet, even though they do not need it. Is there no restroom in Parliament? It helps to get out of your seat and move around.
