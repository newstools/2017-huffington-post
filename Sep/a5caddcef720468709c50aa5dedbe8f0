The Walter Sisulu University student who made headlines for spending over R800 000 of an erroneous R14 million grant payment was taken away by police on Monday night after a media conference she was attending erupted into chaos, according to Independent Online. Sibongile Mani received R14 million from the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) instead of R1,400 four months ago and has since been spending thousands on parties, clothes and phones -- all of which was posted on social media. An investigation into the incident has been launched. At the time, university spokesperson Yonela Tukwayo confirmed that a student had accidentally received a staggering R14 million in her student account. She blamed the accident on a technical glitch. On Monday evening, the Pan-Africanist Student Movement of Azania (Pasma), of which Mani is a member, held a media conference on a pavement just outside the Walter Sisulu University's College Street Campus in the Eastern Cape after apparently being denied access to a venue by the institution. Hundreds of students turned up to listen to Mani, but Pasma told the media she was not ready to speak to the public. This angered many students. Chaos then erupted with students bringing traffic to a standstill in Buffalo and Oxford streets in East London. Police members then arrived and took Mani away. More on this developing story.
