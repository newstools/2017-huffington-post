Reggie Nkabinde and Beauty Matela's wedding was a lavish affair, with the couple forking out an estimated R60,000 for their wedding cake, according to The Sowetan. Nkabinde is the ANC Youth League treasurer-general and head of record label Mabala Noise. KwaZulu-Natal was the place to be this past weekend as a who's who of celebrities, politicians and business folk gathered for the wedding celebration. Speaking to TshisaLIVE‚ owner of Sugar Coated Cakes Sasha Naidoo‚ said it took a whole month to make the cake. The three metre‚ 100kg‚ pearl-finished "castle-themed" creation was said to be the centre of attention at the wedding. "Beauty wanted a 'statement cake' and when I showed her the samples of the flowers‚ she loved them and coincidentally they matched the flowers on her table centre pieces. So although I spent a lot of time on the details of the cake‚ we knew they would complete the look‚" said Naidoo. She added: "The architectural structure in that picture was similar to a castle‚ it had gold elements that made it elegant and flowers that completed her vision of a beautiful cake." The cake was also covered in pearls and over 2‚000 sugar flowers‚ including hand-made roses‚ peonies‚ orchids‚ hydrangeas and small daisies‚ which took over three weeks to make. Four tiers of the cake were real traditional fruit cake while the bottom two tiers were artificial.
