Jim Walker -- a former Fox, NBC, and CBS news anchor -- is making headlines in his new career as an adult performer, particularly for his big, um, "personality" on screen. Walker, who won two regional Emmys during his 23-year television career, now goes by the name of Dallas Steele -- a name given to him for his debut roles in (very NSFW) website Titan Men. It was on Titan Men that Walker first came out about his past -- a story that stayed under the radar, until recently. Just finished a fun photo shoot with @marekrichard . Check out their new selection later this month. Just in time for pride A post shared by Jim Walker (@daddydallassteele) on Jun 6, 2017 at 12:04pm PDT  In an interview recently, Walker spoke about the change of career: "I am as comfortable in a suit as I am a jockstrap. "I left the business in 2013 after my boss in Southwest Florida told me that research had shown 'people here just don't like you'. "Add to that the immense pressure of daily ratings where your job is virtually on the line every single day. "TV news as we know it is dying, and the old-school model is trying to divide a financial pie that has shrunk by 75 percent in just 15 years. "I miss telling great stories, I miss the rush of sharing breaking news and I miss getting to know viewers." But, he said in an interview: "I'm much more successful in every measure than I ever was before."
