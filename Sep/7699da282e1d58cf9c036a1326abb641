The DA's motion to dissolve parliament failed in the National Assembly late on Tuesday. The main opposition party called also called for early elections, reasoning that the country needed a change in leadership and could not be run by President Jacob Zuma and the ANC.Smaller opposition parties such as the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), Inkhata Freedom Party and the United Democratic Movement made it clear they did not support the motion.Only 83 MPs supported the motion, while 229 voted against it. There were seven abstentions.EFF deputy president Floyd Shivambu warned the DA to stop undermining them."We gave the DA an opportunity on August 8, but it made a tactical mistake by wanting to take all the glory. Don't undermine us. Don't undermine other parties..."You are going to offend people who were going to give you the responsibility to lead the country [in 2019]," said Shivambu.Shivambu also accused the party of trying to steal the glory in the motion of no confidence vote against Zuma last month. This is despite support from other opposition parties, as well as some ANC MPs.
