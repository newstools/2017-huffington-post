On Wednesday night, EFF leader Julius Malema was awarded his second degree, and photos from the event are enough to make you want to don robes yourself. The commander-in-chief got a BA honours degree in philosophy from the College of Human Sciences at Unisa.  The moment Malema worked so hard for:  Compromises had to be made, he says.  And that it really wasn't easy.  But look how proud his family is.  And of course, the EFF's spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi -- aka The People's Bae -- was also there. What a friend. A lot of EFF members also turned up for the special event.  Afterwards, he stole the limelight in his class photos. Look at the yellow stole! #winning   You can watch the whole ceremony here.
