Absa on Thursday bolstered its efforts to have the Public Protector's controversial report ordering it to repay R1.125 billion reviewed and set aside. The bank's supplementary affidavit to the High Court, following the original filed on 13 July, argues there are further grounds for the dismissal of her remedial findings. In the report released in June, Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane ordered Absa to pay back over a billion rand following an apartheid reserve bank bailout granted to Bankorp, subsequently bought by Absa. In Absa's supplementary affidavit submitted on Thursday, it claims the further grounds for dismissal of the report are as follows: Mkhwebane came under fire this week after a supplementary affidavit by the SA Reserve Bank revealed that she met with representatives from both the presidency and SSA before finalising the Absa report.

"We maintain that the Public Protector violated Absa's right to procedural fairness in the manner in which she imposed the remedial action," the bank said. "These rights have been further violated by meetings with the SSA and the presidency's legal advisers". Absa said it looked forward to the case being brought to court so it could be "put to rest" and all South Africans "get an opportunity to hear the facts and watch them be interrogated".
