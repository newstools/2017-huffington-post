What do you get when you mix Jennifer Lawrence, Emma Stone, sheer paneling and sparkles? Red carpet royalty, that’s what.  The two were spotted hanging out at the afterparty for Lawrence’s new movie “Mother!” in New York on Wednesday. Lawrence continued on her stylish premiere streak in a high-neck, sparkly rose-gold Ralph & Russo gown with a car wash skirt. Stone also wore a high-neck dress, which was completely sheer up top save for what looked like a censor bar over her chest.  The friends appeared to have recovered from what the internet widely referred to as one very awkward hug at an event during the Toronto Film Festival on Tuesday. And can we talk about that hair? Fall might be right around the corner, but we’re suddenly feeling inclined to go beach blonde.   Share this slide:
