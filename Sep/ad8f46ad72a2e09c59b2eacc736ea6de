African National Congress spokesman Zizi Kodwa says the Pietermaritzburg High Court ruling which declared KwaZulu-Natal's elective conference unlawful will have no effect on the party's national conference in December."There are no implications to the national conference in December because there is no relationship between the two," Kodwa said in a telephonic interview with HuffPost SA.He was asked if the court order would result in the national conference being moved to a later date to accommodate for a new provincial executive committee to be elected in KwaZulu-Natal.It also appears that the current PEC will appeal the ruling.ANC KZN spokesman Mdumiseni Ntuli said it "is inevitable" that the ruling will be appealed within the 16-day period which the court has granted them."We, together with our legal team, are going to be studying the content and implications of the judgement so we can consult the national executive committee on the way forward," Ntuli said.Kodwa had a similar sentiment in a statement issued by the party after the ruling."The ANC will study the judgment as delivered and interact with our structures on the political ramifications of the decision prior to placing the matter before the appropriate political platform for a decision on the way forward," he said.Judge Jerome Nguni handed down the judgement in the Pietermaritzburg High Court on Tuesday, saying the outcome of the eighth KZN provincial elective conference in November 2015 was unlawful and void.Currently, president Jacob Zuma frontman, Sihle Zikalala, stands at the helm of the ANC in the KwaZulu-Natal.Zikalala and his comrades, like KZN ANC secretary Super Zuma, are staunch and unwavering Zuma supporters and have thrown their weight behind Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma as the country's next leader.But KZN's veteran leaders, who were ousted in the 2015 provincial elective conference, and who still enjoy favour in many regions, are fighting to overthrow the Zuma camp.The Cyril Ramaphosa allies, led by former KZN Premier Senzo Mchunu, have instituted court proceedings to have the results of the conference declared null and void. Citing procedural flaws, they believe the election was rigged.One of these alleged anomalies includes the tweeting of the results by an official ANC account while voting was still under way.The judgement could be one of the major influencing factors in the outcome of the ANC national conference in December.
