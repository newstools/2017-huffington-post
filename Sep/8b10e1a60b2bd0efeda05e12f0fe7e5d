The drought-stricken City of Cape Town's water calculator recommends that you flush your toilet a maximum of three times per day to help preserve water, Times Live reported. Xanthea Limberg‚ mayoral committee member for water, said the city recommended that people "only flush when necessary". "Don't use it as a dustbin. If it's yellow let it mellow. If it's brown‚ flush it down.'' The publication reported that the city asked residents to get used to the ''new normal" allocation of 87 litres of water per person per day. With this amount of water per day, the online calculator estimates that you may: have a four-minute shower, have three toilet flushes, wash dishes once, wash your hands and face once, brush your teeth twice, prepare two cooked meals, drink seven glasses of water and give your pet one large bowl of water. This comes to about 84 litres of water per day.
