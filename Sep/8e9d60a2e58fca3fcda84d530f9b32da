Police have confirmed the explosion on a packed rush hour tube train at Parsons Green, which injured 22 people, is being investigated as a terrorist incident.Metropolitan Police assistant commissioner Mark Rowley said it was an &ldquo;improvised explosive device&rdquo;.&nbsp;The Met&rsquo;s Counter Terrorism Command confirmed they were investigating.Pictures on social media showed a fire in a bucket inside a Lidl bag with what appeared to be wires sticking out.The incident caused mass panic at the station and what one witness called &ldquo;a horrendous human pile-on&rdquo; as people fled.A manhunt is now underway for the perpetrator, although reports of a man with a knife were investigated by the Met Police but later stood down.Armed police pulled a bus over on Chelsea Bridge, but the Met Police told HuffPost UK that it was simply the case that the driver had been cold and wearing a balaclava, thus prompting concerns,Rowley said: &ldquo;There are many urgent inquiries ongoing with hundreds of detectives involved, looking at CCTV, carrying out forensic work and speaking to witnesses.&ldquo;I am appealing for anyone who has information that would assist detectives to contact the hotline on 0800 789 321. I would also urge anyone with images or moving footage from the scene to upload them at www.ukpoliceimageappeal.co.uk.&rdquo;Deputy Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu, the senior national coordinator for counter-terrorism policing, declared it a terrorist incident nearly two hours after it happened on Friday morning.Rowley said he understood that &ldquo;most&rdquo; of the injured were suffering from &ldquo;flash burns&rdquo;.It was the scariest moment in my life... a wave of ppl coming downstairs, school children, elderly... people burned... #parsonsgreen #london pic.twitter.com/p1hPaqswtfOne man, Peter Crowley, tweeted pictures of his head after he suffered burns by the &ldquo;fireball&rdquo;.Chard head from the fireball at #ParsonsGreen pic.twitter.com/9yohdYuHBjEmma Steventon, 27, who lives in Parsons Green told HuffPost UK she heard &ldquo;lots of screaming&rdquo; and was told to run but didn&rsquo;t know why.She said: &ldquo;Everyone just got crushed on the stairs, it was like a human pile-on, stampede, it was horrendous.&ldquo;I had a lady underneath me shouting that she was pregnant and the pressure of more and more people falling on top because we couldn&rsquo;t get down the stairs quickly enough.&rdquo;Witness Olaniyi Shokunbia told HuffPost the explosion and stampede happened within 15 seconds.He said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just crazy.
