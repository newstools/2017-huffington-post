We bet President Jacob Zuma is breathing a sigh of relief that the weekend is finally here, given the week that he had -- but then again, he has not been having the best time for a while now. It's no secret that Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) members have resorted to referring to Zuma as Ubaba ka Duduzane (Duduzane's father) since the no-confidence vote against him in August. During his latest question-and-answer session in Parliament on Thursday, Zuma lost his cool with the leaders of the red berets, Julius Malema, much to the amusement of Twitter users. Last week, Zuma's firstborn son, Edward, interrupted former finance minister Pravin Gordhan's address at the Gandhi Memorial Lecture in Pietermaritzburg, calling him a liar.

Malema asked Zuma why he had not taken any legal action against people who put him at the centre of state capture if the claims were not true, to which he responded: "Every day in this country, people say things about me. Should I stand here and take everyone to court? You say things about me, but I don't take people like you to court." Another of Zuma's sons, Duduzane, has been in the headlines for, among other things, his friendship and dealings with the controversial Gupta family.

Ndlozi asked one of the candidates, Rachel Kalidass, what she thought of SABC1's new drama series, Tjovitjo.  One thing's certain about South Africans -- we are a special bunch, stru , our humour knows no limits.
