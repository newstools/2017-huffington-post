Two male lions have been seen copulating at a Yorkshire zoo in the UK by a visitor, raising familiar arguments about the prevalence of homosexuality in the animal kingdom. The photos of the incident, caught by amateur wildlife photographer Russ Bridges, also show a female lion nearby who appears to be unfussed by the two male lions going at it next to her.

"A fair few people were watching this going on and laughing - they were all commenting on what it looked like," Bridges told The Daily Mail. A group of gay lions is called a gay pride.  "I think it was a bit of a 'should have gone to Specsavers' moment as the lioness was just lying there next to them. In fairness, though, every time a male went near her she snarled and swiped their faces with her paw. This is so adorable. Two male lions seen being together.

I don't know if it's a dominance thing or something like that - it looks as if they are aggressive, but it's all play between friends," Bridges said. A similar encounter was captured last summer in northern Botswana, reported National Geographic, but a zoologist insisted it wasn't two males, but rather a female lion with a mane. "If a lion mother had abnormally high androgens during pregnancy, her female offspring may end up 'masculinised," the zoologist says. "[It's] a situation that occurs occasionally in people, but that is rarely observed in wild animals."
