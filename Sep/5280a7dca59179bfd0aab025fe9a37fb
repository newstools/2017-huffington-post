Freddie Mercury would have turned 71 years old today. The legendary singer and frontman of British glam rock band Queen died of complications of HIV/Aids in November 1991 at the age of 45.  Queen had multiple hits with songs such as "Bohemian Rhapsody", "I Want to Break Free", "We Will Rock You" and "Radio Gaga", among many others. A special birthday video with snippets of interviews with Mercury was distributed on social media by Queen's official YouTube page in memory of the formidable performer.
