At Sunday's Emmy Awards, the actor's portrayal of the president earned him the statue for Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series. Alec Baldwin deserves this award. #Emmyspic.twitter.com/a7qnBXNJIN During his acceptance speech, he burned Trump a couple times, saying, "At long last, Mr. President, here is your Emmy," referencing the fact that Trump has yet to take one home. (Host Stephen Colbert also joked about Trump's lack of Emmys earlier in the show.)
