Parliament will only investigate Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa's alleged hacked email accounts once he has laid a complaint with the joint standing committee on intelligence (JSCI). JSCI chairperson Charles Nqakula said in a short statement that, once Ramaphosa submits a detailed complaint, the committee would ask the Inspector-General of Intelligence to intervene. "The person who alleges wrongdoing by [the] State Security [Agency] should submit a complaint with the relevant facts to the JSCI. whereafter we shall ask the Inspector-General of Intelligence to investigate." In a statement on Saturday, Ramaphosa said there was a "likelihood" that state agencies and resources were being abused to promote factional political agendas. Numerous calls on Monday to the spokesperson of the State Security Agency, Brian Dube, went unanswered. Sunday Independent at the weekend published an article alleging that Ramaphosa was involved in a number of extramarital affairs. He subsequently admitted to having one affair. The newspaper made reference to leaked emails from the deputy president's personal email accounts. In a court bid on Saturday, Ramaphosa failed to prevent the newspaper from publishing the story. Once it was published, Ramaphosa said he and his wife had been financially assisting 54 students, both men and women, some of whom were mentioned in the email. He admitted to having an affair with his doctor eight years ago, but maintained he had resolved this with his wife. Ramaphosa's spokesperson, Tyrone Seale, could not be reached for comment.
