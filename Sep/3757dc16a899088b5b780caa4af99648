The internet is barely coping following the release of gqom song "Ubaba kaDuduzane" and we totally understand why.The song, which was created by Wits University medical student Thabo "Tboy Daflame " Moagi, went viral overnight and it looks like it will be the jam to get down to come the long weekend.Listening to #uBabaKaDuduzane in the office wasn't a good idea. It's on repeat and left me in "Friday mode".Moagi told TimesLive that he created the track to educate people about current affairs, but not to make a political statement.EFF members have resorted to referring to Zuma as Ubaba ka Duduzane (Duduzane's father) since the no-confidence vote against him in August.Read: Here's Why We Think Jacob Zuma Is Glad This Week Is Finally OverDuring a question-and-answer session in Parliament earlier this month, Zuma lost his cool with the leaders of the red berets, Julius Malema, much to the amusement of Twitter users.#SouthAfrica's President Jacob Zuma and opposition leader Julius Malema got into a heated argument in parliament pic.twitter.com/6pl9NcDoukIf you have not seen the video taking social media by storm, don't panic because we've got you:#uBabaKaDuduzane Issa hit pic.twitter.com/bBCIGRgMCMHere's what tweeps had to say:#uBabaKaDuduzane Fam yeeeeerrrrrrr pic.twitter.com/ndR62xABCr#uBabaKaDuduzane rock's pic.twitter.com/pq8TTsjdDMIt just dawned on me, AGAIN, that #uBabaKaDuduzane is My Jam.
