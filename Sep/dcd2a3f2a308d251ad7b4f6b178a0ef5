The Hawks have strongly denied that they are after former finance minister Pravin Gordhan, Business Day reported on Friday. This week, it emerged that the Hawks had asked former finance minister Trevor Manuel and former deputy finance minister Jabu Moleketi to provide affidavits about allegations that a unit within the SA Revenue Service (Sars) had bugged the offices of the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) in 2007. This sparked fears that the Hawks were ready to target Gordhan, who was previously questioned in relation to those allegations and then later charged with an administrative offence related to the resignation of an official, but those charges were dropped. In an interview with Business Day on Thursday, Hawks spokesperson Hangwani Malaudzi said Gordhan was not under investigation and said a final docket had not yet been handed to the NPA. On Wednesday, the Hawks confirmed they had written to Manuel and Moleketi asking for affidavits. The two had until Friday to comply. Manuel told News24 he had been subpoenaed by the Hawks, while Moleketi was unavailable for comment. "It is true that the Hawks have requested the pleasure of my company. I don't know what it is exactly they want to talk to me about as I am abroad," Manuel reportedly said. The investigation allegedly involves the bugging of the NPA offices by two Sars officials, supposedly part of the "rogue unit". Senior sources told Business Day the investigation was at an advanced stage with two Sars officials having turned state witness.
