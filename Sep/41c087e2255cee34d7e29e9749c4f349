Award-winning fashion blogger Aisha Baker and South African cricketer husband Wayne Parnell are giving us all the feels with their sun-kissed images from their Barbados trip. The couple visited the island as Parnell geared up to play in the Caribbean Premier League - a T20 cricket tournament which coincides with a colourful carnival experience in the Caribbean. We cannot get over their recent posts, each one giving us all the FOMO and of course setting the bar in couple goals. Don't believe it? Take a look.
