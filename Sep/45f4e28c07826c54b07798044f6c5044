After days of complicated manoeuvres to get WiFi access down into South Africa's unexplored paleolithic caves, Wits University's star paleoanthropologist Professor Lee Berger has announced the first live stream from one of its expeditions. And you can join in! At 4pm on Thursday, archaeological enthusiast can join Berger and his expert team for a field trip to the Rising Star cave system in South Africa, where you can learn about their latest expedition and newest discoveries. You can watch the live stream below, which we think is going to be epic.  And also follow regular updates online from Berger himself.
