There is no such thing as no-go areas, ANC presidential hopeful Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma told supporters in the Dullah Omar region of the Cape Metro a month after she was booted out of Marikana."It can't be that there are 'no-go' areas in the ANC. It just can't be. We all must be given a chance to campaign wherever we can," IOL quoted her telling supporters.She was last month chased away by members of the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) in the North West area of Marikana, as they accused her of using the Marikana tragedy to score political points.Read Here: Dlamini-Zuma Chased Away In MarikanaOn 10 August this year, it was the five-year commemoration since unrest at the Lonmin mine in Marikana set in motion days of violence and bloodshed, as protracted struggles by workers for a living wage descended into national tragedy.Police opened fire on mine workers and 44 people were killed, and dozens of others injured.In Nyanga, Cape Town, Dlamini-Zuma told a small crowd that whoever wins at the upcoming December conference must lead and embrace everyone."There is one thing we need to be clear about. Whoever wins in December must lead and embrace everyone. The person who loses must follow," she said, according to IOL.Recent reports suggest that President Jacob Zuma may be ready to reshuffle his Cabinet again after it was announced this week that Dlamini-Zuma will be sworn in as an MP.The Sunday Times reported that Zuma was expected to appoint Dlamini-Zuma as minister of higher education as his relations with Blade Nzimande are at an all-time low.The paper also reported that Dlamini-Zuma would be the one to make the announcement about free education at tertiary level, which would win her favour with voters.Should a reshuffle happen, it would be a second one this year after a dramatic one in March that saw the sacking of Pravin Gordhan as finance minister.City Press reported that Dlamini-Zuma's move to Parliament leaves the door open for Zuma to make an early exit from government once a successor has been appointed at the ANC's elective conference in December.In her address on Sunday, Dlamini-Zuma reminded the ANC Youth League that the struggle for liberation was led mostly by young people, who needed to be honoured.On Sunday, Dlamini-Zuma touched on the catchphrase "radical economic transformation"."Our economy must grow, and black people must be a part of it. The demands of our time need skills so that young people can drive this country."Black people must drive it and women must be leading. The demand is that we cannot continue like this, rich in all sorts of minerals, but the majority are poor."We must solve that paradox of a rich South Africa and poor South Africa. The demand is that we can't continue with two cities in Cape Town. There is a city that is rich and [another] that is poor."
