It's the latest instalment of the "Free Willy" franchise you never saw coming.What should have been a simple trip to the gym has culminated in a man having a team of firefighters, equipped with a cutting grinder, vibrating saw and "hydraulic rescue device", free his penis from a 2.5kg dumbbell disc.The curious gym goer from the German town of Worms, south of Frankfurt, was caught in the weight for three hours after what one can only assume followed a decision to step-up his weight lifting routine.In a Facebook post, the firefighters asked people to "not imitate such actions!"It's not known whether the bloke managed to get it up -- or, indeed, if he will ever be able to again.
