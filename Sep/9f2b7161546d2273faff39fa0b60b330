Businessman Kenny Kunene has claimed that unknown gunmen opened fire on him after trying to push his BMW from the road in Waverley in Johannesburg on Tuesday night. TimesLIVE reports that Kunene was on his way home after hanging out with his friend, Sunday Independent editor Steve Motale. "I'm not okay. Fortunately nobody is hurt. I wasn't hurt," he told the publication shortly after the alleged incident. According to Kunene, Motale's bodyguard warned them "not to drive together". Kunene told ANN7 that he was aware of being followed, but that he "brushed it off". Kunene claims that a white SUV then tried to push him off the road and when he braked, "they stopped in front of me they opened the doors, took out the gun, cocked their gun and I was facing death. I reversed and they started shooting at the car." According to Kunene, the police couldn't be bothered and left without collecting evidence such as bullet casings. It is not clear whether there was any substantial damage to his car. Kunene is now convinced that the shooting was a "hit" on his life. At the weekend, Sunday Independent published an article that claimed Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa had had numerous affairs. Ramaphosa has apologised for having one affair eight years ago, but has dismissed the other claims. Motale has allegedly been receiving death threats since publishing the story.
