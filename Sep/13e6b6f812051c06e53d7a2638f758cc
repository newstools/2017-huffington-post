The SA Communist Party (SACP) has started engaging with Cosatu-affiliated unions to secure their support for when Cosatu decides whether or not to follow the SACP when it leaves the tripartite alliance, Business Day reported on Thursday. The SACP resolved in June that it would contest elections on its own, reportedly with the caveat that it would consider this "within the wider context of the need to unite and reconfigure the alliance". At the Cosatu march against corruption on Wednesday, the SACP reportedly called for support, should it contest the 2019 election alone. SACP general secretary Blade Nzimande reportedly said: "We have taken a resolution to contest elections ... we do not want to go there on our own." He reportedly called on workers to "go back and talk about that" [that the SACP should contest elections]. According to Times Live, Nzimande lashed out at government's failure to act against state capture. He said: "Let us make a vow as workers that our money which has been stolen and is in Dubai must be traced and let us get it back. Every cent of it. That money belongs to the people of this country. We are saying to the Hawksâ€š why are you sitting back and not acting against this broad looting of the state. Why is the NPA not acting?"
