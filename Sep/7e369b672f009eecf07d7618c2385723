The ANC has called for a vote of no confidence against Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba. On Thursday, Mashaba came out and dismissed the "antics" used by the ANC, according to TimesLive. "After only 13 months in office‚ this move should be dismissed as the antics of a desperate party trying to come to terms with its new role [as the] opposition‚" Mashaba said in a statement. "The ANC cites so-called financial distress in the city as the primary grounds for the motion. The reality is that, despite the institutionalised corruption inherited‚ we have a financial state that is stable. The ANC was dishonest in government‚ and its relationship with the truth has continued its demise." Mashaba has been driving an anti-corruption campaign that has already seen various council employees being arrested.   "The fact is that this baseless allegation is a smokescreen aimed at assuming control that [will] allow the looting to continue once again, because change threatens the very survival of the ANC‚" Mashaba said.
