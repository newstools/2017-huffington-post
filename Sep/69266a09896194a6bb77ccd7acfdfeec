National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) boss Shaun Abrahams says his office is assisting the Hawks to conduct an multifaceted investigation into state capture and the Gupta family. Abrahams and his team appeared before Parliament's portfolio committee on justice and correctional services on Wednesday, where he was grilled by committee members on the performance on the NPA, especially relating to issues around the Guptas, state capture and Zimbabwe's First Lady Grace Mugabe.

My silence does not mean no work is being done," he told the committee.  Abrahams said the leaked Gupta emails form part of an eight-pronged investigation by the Hawks into former public protector Thuli Madonsela's State of Capture report. The NPA is assisting with the investigation. The investigation delves into Gupta-owned companies such as The New Age, Tegeta and VR Laser. The team, whose members are being kept secret, is also probing bribery allegations made by former deputy finance minister Mcebisi Jonas.

EWN also reported that Abrahams denied ever having met with Grace Mugabe's lawyers, distancing himself from claims that he was involved in the granting of her diplomatic immunity.  Since the #GuptaLeaks emerged in June, opposition parties and civil-society organisations have been calling for the NPA and the Hawks to investigate the allegations and prosecute those found guilty. Abrahams was constantly criticised for his silence on the matter. Abrahams gave no indication on when the investigations would be finalised.
