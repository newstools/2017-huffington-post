Cape Peninsula University of Technology's Cape Town campus had to be shut down after an arson attack on Monday morning, according to Eyewitness News. Students on campus claim masked men entered the premises and started making threats. The protesters then forced staff and students out of buildings and started a fire in a hall. It is unclear at this stage what the protests are about; however, some media reports state that students are fighting for insourcing of workers and against student suspensions.

CPUT spokesperson Lauren Kansley said: "We believe petrol bombs were used to set fire to a number of classrooms, but private security and the fire department managed to get the situation under control before the fire could cause more damage." Last month, the institution was forced to close its Cape Town campus owing to student protests.
