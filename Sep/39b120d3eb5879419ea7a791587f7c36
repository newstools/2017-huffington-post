Freelance photojournalist Jono Wood was at the scene of an attack on two Uber taxi drivers last night in Sandton, Johannesburg. Two Uber cars were petrol-bombed outside the Gautrain station, leading to a retaliation where Uber drivers attacked metered taxis, EWN reports. This comes after rising tensions in the area between metered taxis and Uber drivers have led to escalating conflict in central transport hubs, such as the Gautrain station in Sandton, where hundreds of travellers arrive daily. Woods' photographs show a taxi being set alight and then, half an hour later, show a metered taxi burnt out in the street with pedestrians looking on.

"This is very painful, this is very painful," one driver said.  Police were taking statements from people who were on the scene last night, EWN reported. p
