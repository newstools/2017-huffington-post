A hostel dweller in KwaMashu in KwaZulu-Natal has been arrested for the murder of former ANC Youth League (ANCYL) secretary-general Sindiso Magaqa, The Sowetan reported on Monday. Magaqa was part of the ANCYL's leadership during Julius Malema's term as ANCYL president, and died in hospital in July after being shot during a suspected ambush near Durban. His funeral was held on Saturday. Magaqa was a councillor at the Umthimkhulu municipality when he was killed. According to Sowetan, the man arrested is suspected of shooting Magaqa and two other councillors, Nontikelelo Mafa and Jabu Msiya, and was arrested on September 1. Hawks spokesman Hangwani Mulaudzi reportedly confirmed the arrest and said the suspect would appear in court soon. More arrests are imminent, he said. A source close to the investigation told Sowetan that the suspect was part of 10 armed men who were involved in a shootout with police on the N2 between Harding and Kokstad on September 1. They were allegedly on their way to a cash-in-transit robbery when they were arrested. Three of the men were reportedly killed during the shootout that ensued. A number of firearms were reportedly confiscated. According to The Citizen, Magaqa's uncle believed he was shot for exposing corruption at the municipality. He also believed factions within the ruling party were behind Magaqa's death. "We love the comrades [the ANC] but when they do this‚ we are scared. Everything points to December [the ANC's national elective conference]‚" he reportedly said.
