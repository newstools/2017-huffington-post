The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) has hit back at Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane in an explosive affidavit, revealing that she met with both the presidency and the State Security Agency (SSA). According to tweets by EWN's Barry Bateman and eNCA's Karyn Maughan she discussed the SARB's mandate with presidential advisers and how the SARB might be "vulnerable".#ReserveBank Mkhwebane met with the Presidency advisors 12 days before final report released. Constitutional changes were discussed. BBShe met with both the presidency and the SSA in the course of finalising her investigation into the CIEX Report into apartheid-era looting. It's quite remarkable that she would meet with the presidency to discuss the SARB's future mandate without the SARB's input. In her report she said the mandate must change, but this was struck down by the court later.#ReserveBank Not even SARB was privy to proposed Constitutional changes, but they were discussed with the Presidency. No right of reply.

Many fear that the SARB is the next target of the so-called rent-seekers and the state capture network after Pravin Gordhan was removed as minister of finance in March by President Jacob Zuma. Kganyago is demanding answers:Reverse Bank demands @PublicProtector provide a transcript of meeting with Presidency over Bank mandate - or explain why it wasn't recordedThis is a developing story.
