Troubles are escalating at public relations firm Bell Pottinger, which confirmed with HuffPost South Africa this morning that they are looking to sell the business. "We have appointed a BDO to consider all the options available for the business. This includes a sale of the business but that is by no means the only option," a spokesperson told HuffPost this morning. "All options are being considered, including, like many other companies currently do, establishing a new board and management structure that will operate independently of the ownership of the business." Bell Pottinger was hauled before a trade body hearing over its work on a campaign for Oakbay Capital, a South African company owned by the wealthy and controversial Gupta family. Bell Pottinger was accused by the DA of stoking racial hatred. PRCA On Bell Pottinger: "There Is Something Rotten At The Heart Of The Company" The report by the PRCA found that Bell Pottinger's work on certain strategies was in breach of relevant ethical principles. The conditions of its expulsion means it will not be eligible to reapply for corporate membership of the PRCA for a minimum period of five years, even if it attempts to change its name. The spokesperson also told HuffPost that they wouldn't be commenting on the recent BBC interview with Lord Bell, where he repeatedly denied his involvement, and said all senior management should quit. "We are not going to comment on spurious speculation by Lord Bell," they said.
