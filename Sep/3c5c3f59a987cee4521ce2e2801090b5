But because I grew up watching my mom, looking up to her, I grew up being aware of her journey and her struggle. It was important for me to see this role as I've always seen her. It was important for me to give respect to the life of a legend," Pheto said. Pheto, who was the night's biggest winner, was also nominated for the Best International Actress category, which was won by Nigerian actress Nse Ikpe-Etim for her role in Tess.  South African celebs took to social media to congratulate Pheto on her wins.
