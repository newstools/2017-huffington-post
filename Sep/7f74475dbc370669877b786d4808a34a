Johannesburg-based chef Zanele Van Zyl shared her favourite meal to prepare this spring. Van Zyl, who is also a fitness fanatic, said people should not be pressured to look a certain way simply because of a season change. "Spring may have sprung, but take your time to build the body you want by eating good food and exercising. As far as food is concerned, I believe that whatever it is you cook for yourself and your family - as long as it comes from a place of love - you will be just fine," she said. Van Zyl shared her recipe for a prawn-and-guacamole cocktail, which she said was foolproof.       Van Zyl hosts cooking classes in cities throughout the country. Happy spring day!
