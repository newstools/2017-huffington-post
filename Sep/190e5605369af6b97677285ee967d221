The Kenya Supreme Court on Friday declared President Uhuru Kenyatta's election win invalid due to irregularities committed by the election board and ordered a new election within 60 days. "The declaration [of Kenyatta's win] is invalid, null and void," said Judge David Maranga, announcing the verdict of four out of the six judges.
