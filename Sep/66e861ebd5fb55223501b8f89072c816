The current ANC is in shambles and whoever replaces President Jacob Zuma will have to start from scratch and clean up his mess, former president Kgalema Motlanthe said on Wednesday. "Whoever takes over is going to start from scratch", he said on the Eusebius McKaiser Show on radio 702 about the state of South Africa 23 years after democracy. "The current leadership does itself a disservice and the structures from within act as if they are the organisation," he said.

"Conscience is what separates us from the animal kingdom... conscience is treated as something not important within the ANC," he said. He stressed that the current political turmoil within the ruling party was caused by the current leadership and Zuma. Motlanthe was referring to the fact that Zuma has been implicated in one scandal after another since he took office in 1999, first as deputy president of the country and then as president. From an allegedly corrupt relationship with the Gupta family to multi-million security rand upgrades to his Nkandla home, to alleged corruption in the arms deal -- the list goes on.

"Bantu education has created this situation, this education meant that Africans will not be productive in the economy," he said.
