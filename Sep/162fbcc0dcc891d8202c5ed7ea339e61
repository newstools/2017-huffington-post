ANC treasurer-general Zweli Mkhize said he expects dirty campaigns against him as he runs for the country's top spot, but maintains he has nothing to hide. He said he would accept a nomination from ANC branches for any position, including president. "The nomination process will be announced in the next few weeks, the branches will start nominating... I have been approached by a number of leaders and branch members and I have said I would be honoured if there was a nomination on my name. "I will accept any nomination... I expect that between now and the end of the year there will be lots of engagement." Mkhize: I would be honoured to accept a top leadership position in the ANC. Ultimately up to branches to decide. @HuffPostSA @ANCTGMkhize pic.twitter.com/YNMiVkC6pZ Mkhize slammed the use of smear campaigns in the run-up to the party's national conference in December. "The dirty tricks are not something that one really believes is the right way to go, to try throw around fake news and dirty tricks into the scenario we are. We need that environment not to be polluted by externalities," he said. "It is possible that people will pick up and try and create smear campaigns, that is not within our control. I don't have anything that I feel would disqualify one from participating in the leadership of the ANC collective that will appear in December." Mkhize: I would like to contribute in bringing more unity and understanding among leaders in the ANC. We don't want splits. @ANCTGMkhize Asked what he could bring to the table as president, Mkhize gave a short answer: "One of the main issues is being able to understand that ANC leadership works as a team, as a collective".
