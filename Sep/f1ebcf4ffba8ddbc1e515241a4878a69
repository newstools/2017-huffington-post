ANC treasurer-general Zweli Mkhize has denied claims that he tried to manipulate President Jacob Zuma's rape accuser Fezeka Kuzwayo to drop the charges him.EWN reported that in a statement, Mkhize explained how he came to know of sexual relations between Zuma and Kuzwayo, who is more affectionately known as Khwezi.He says after the president told him that he had made a terrible mistake he reached out to Khwezi and her mother.Mkhize reportedly said he also arranged a legal adviser for the family who he had never met and had given no directive.According to a City Press article, Mkhize advised Kwezi not to use the National Prosecuting Authority's witness protection programme as it was to be discontinued but to rather enter the police's programme.The article claims that the police then recorded all her interviews and sessions with her psychologist but the tapes disappeared compromising confidentiality.Mkhize, however, claims he did not interfere in the legal process after finding the family a lawyer.
