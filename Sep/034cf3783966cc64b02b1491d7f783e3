Civil defence officials in northeast Mexico say a light rain was accompanied by small fish that fell from the sky. Tamaulipas civil defence said in a brief statement that rain on Tuesday in the coastal city of Tampico included fish. Photos posted on the agency's Facebook page show four small fish in a bag and another on a sidewalk. According the US Library of Congress, it's a phenomenon that has been reported since ancient times. Scientists believe that tornadoes over water - known as waterspouts - could be responsible for sucking fish into the air where they are blown around until being released to the ground.
