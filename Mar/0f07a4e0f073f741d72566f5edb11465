Emma Watson and Amanda Seyfried have reportedly taken legal action after their personal photos were leaked online. “Photos from a clothes fitting Emma had with a stylist a couple of years ago have been stolen,” Watson’s publicist said in a statement to The Huffington Post. “They are not nude photographs. Lawyers have been instructed and we are not commenting further.” Seyfried has yet to comment on the leak, but The Huffington Post has reached out and will update this post accordingly. However, TMZ reports the actress’ lawyer has contacted the website that hosted the photos and demanded they remove them immediately. Along with Watson and Seyfried, “Crazy, Stupid, Love” actress Analeigh Tipton also fell victim to online hackers who shared her personal photos online. “The photographs of Analeigh Tipton recently posted online were obtained illegally and are a tremendous invasion of her privacy,” Tipton’s lawyer, Scott Whitehead, said in a statement to HuffPost. “She is cooperating with authorities in an effort to locate the people responsible in the hopes that this never happens to her or anyone else again.  We ask that you respect her privacy at this time.” At this time, it is unclear whether the three incidents are related, but the news recalls the massive 2014 leak which targeted celebrities like Jennifer Lawrence and Kate Upton. Two different men were sentenced to jail in connection with the 2014 incident, although authorities believe they may have been operating independently. Ryan Collins and Edward Majerczyk were charged for hacking accounts of various celebrities and stealing personal information, including nude photos. However, neither of the men were charged with posting or sharing the photos online. This post has been updated to include information about Analeigh Tipton as well as a statement from her lawyer.
