Struggle stalwart Winnie Madikizela-Mandela is in good spirits, despite still being in hospital, her spokesperson Victor Dlamini told News24 on Saturday. "She is absolutely fine and doing great. I am sure that the doctors will discharge her very soon," Dlamini said. Madikizela-Mandela was admitted to the Milpark Hospital in Johannesburg on Wednesday. Dlamini said he had been spending a lot of time with Madikizela-Mandela. "She is in good spirits and just yesterday [Friday] we were looking at some photos on my phone," he said. On Friday, he said Madikizela-Mandela was at the hospital for a routine check when her doctors recommended that she stay overnight for observation. Madikizela-Mandela was admitted to the hospital briefly in December for observation. In April last year, she was in hospital after undergoing back surgery. -- News24
