Will Smith lived out a long-held dream of bungee jumping at the Victoria Falls, and filmed his entire epic leap. Video that TMZ posted online on Friday shows the 48-year-old Hollywood movie star falling from the bridge over the waterfall on the Zambia-Zimbabwe border. “Whoa,” the “Bad Boys” star shouted as he plummeted toward the Zambezi River below. “This is going to be a really cool shot. This is crazy!” As he dangled mid-air on the bungee cord for several seconds, Smith revealed how he’d been wanting to bungee at the location for “like 20 years.” “Oh, that was fantastic,” he added, once he was back on firm ground.
