Stephen Colbert ripped President Donald Trump for hiring his own son-in-law for a key job in a newly created department. Jared Kushner, who is married to the president’s elder daughter, Ivanka Trump, has been tapped by the commander in chief to oversee the “overhaul” of the government bureaucracy. “And the government desperately needs overhaul,” Colbert said on the “Late Show” Monday night. “I mean, somebody keeps putting totally unqualified people in charge of really important stuff. That’s gotta stop!” Colbert cracked that the original title of Kushner’s new “Office of American Innovation” was the “Bureau of Obvious Nepotism.” See his full takedown in the clip above.
