If you've got a meeting coming up with Queen Elizabeth II, there are a few things you should brush up on: your knowledge of corgis, the proper way to bow and just what her handbag could be telling you. While meeting with people, Her Majesty apparently uses her handbags to communicate signals to her team, according to royal historian Hugo Vickers in a recently resurfaced interview with People magazine. "It would be very worrying if you were talking to the queen and saw the handbag move from one hand to the other," Vickers said, as that's reportedly a signal she wants to end the conversation. "Someone would come along and say, 'Sir, the Archbishop of Canterbury would very much like to meet you.'" Vickers added that if the queen wants to leave a situation immediately, she'll spin a ring on her finger or put her hand bag on the floor. The handbags in question are generally from Her Majesty's favorite brand, the British luxury brand Launer. The brand first gave the queen a bag in 1968 and she later granted them the Royal Warrant (a high mark of recognition reserved for goods or services that supply Her Majesty, the Duke of Edinburgh or the Prince of Wales). Her Majesty evidently prefers her bags with longer handles, so it's easier to shake people's hands: We're looking at her bags in an entirely new way now!
