There are still hundreds of thousands of children at work in South Africa. A report released on Thursday by Statistics South Africa, the Survey of Activities of Young People, outlines the burden on the country's children. While the situation is slowly improving, there are still many children who are obliged to work to survive. Statistics South Africa's report says: "Child labour" does not include activities like helping around the house for pocket money. "The Child Labour Programme of Action defines child labour as: Work by children under 18 which is exploitative, hazardous or otherwise inappropriate for their age, detrimental to their schooling, or social, physical, mental, spiritual or moral development. Additionally, according to the ILO [International Labour Organisation] the term "child labour" is often defined as work that deprives children of their childhood, their potential and their dignity, and is work that is harmful to their physical and mental development. This is work that affects children's health, personal development and interferes with their schooling and has a negative impact on children's well-being," said the Stats SA report. One in four children doesn't have a parent in the home There were 11.2 million children aged 7 to 17 years in South Africa in 2015, said the report. About 75 percent had both parents still alive. About 40 percent had only one parent living in the household. But about 7 percent were orphans, with neither parent alive; this was higher than five years earlier. Another 18 percent had at least one parent alive but neither parent was living in the household with the child. That means one in four children were not living with either of their parents. Black children were overwhelmingly worse off regarding the lack of parents.
