This is what romance looks like in the 21st century ‚Äï and we're all for it. It all began with a diss on Hulu's "The Mindy Project" and ended with Mindy Kaling agreeing to go on a date with New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker. On Tuesday's episode, Kaling's character Dr. Mindy Lahiri joked that she couldn't believe Booker showed up to her party: "Cory Booker? I can't believe he came. I guess anything to get out of Newark, huh?" On Thursday, Booker tweeted at Kaling that he heard her "Mindy Project" character had dissed Newark and posted a link to a Vogue article on why it's worth visiting. The senator made sure to keep the tweet light-hearted and was quite flirty with his use of emojis ‚Äï not to mention the fact he added "(I still Ô∏è U"). Ouch! @MindyKaling, heard Dr. Lahiri dissed Newark last night ... @VogueMagazine & I disagree : https://t.co/2wP7ZqJKQd (I still Ô∏èU!) pic.twitter.com/FSwfkxenQJ Kaling responded by assuring Booker that anything her character dislikes is actually cool: Senator, if Mindy Lahiri shades it, it means we know it's cool. Thanks for the . It's mutual! https://t.co/KW2ibviREc And then something magical and rom-com worthy happened. He asked her out! On Twitter! You are making my day! Thanks for the clarification. And If the Ô∏èis really mutual... Come have dinner with me in Newark? #PleaseSayYes ü§ûüèæ https://t.co/fI9IYJYZEX And. Then. She. Said. Yes. @CoryBooker yes. Now let me get the PATH train schedule. Are you swooning yet? As this was unfolding in real time PATH chimed in with its train schedule to ensure that this date actually happens. https://t.co/tIYB7JWIh6 Thank you! PATH train is awesome when you are Jersey bound. But you are @Lyft worthy! I will send one to you for the door to door. https://t.co/hTHqqyXLZn So far no word on when the date will happen, but we wish them all the best.
