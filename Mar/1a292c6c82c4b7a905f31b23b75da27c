Many of us know Cole Sprouse as Cody Martin on "The Suite Life Of Zack and Cody" or Jughead on "Riverdale." But before he moved into The Tipton or became best friends with Archie Andrews, Sprouse played Ross Geller's son, Ben, on "Friends." Sprouse recently spoke with the New York Post about his time on "Friends," and revealed that he still gets called "Ben" by fans of the show. "Because 'Friends' is on Netflix, there's a renewed interest in [the show]," Sprouse told the New York Post. "Having responded to a Disney show for such a long time, people can call me 'Ben' on the street and I will turn around." Sprouse also mentioned that he had a big-time crush on one of his adult co-stars. "I had a really, really hard time working with [Jennifer] Aniston because I was so in love with her," Sprouse admitted. "I was infatuated. I was speechless â€• I'd get all bubbly and forget my lines and completely blank ... it was so difficult." Sounds like the Geller men have a type! We're loving Sprouse's recollections from his time on the show. Though he might be Jughead now, he'll always be Ben to us.
