Tomi Lahren has had her show, "Tomi," suspended by TheBlaze, according to The Daily Caller. Sources told the outlet that while the 24-year-old political commentator will be suspended for at least one week, she may not finish out the duration of her contract, which expires in September. Lahren's reported suspension comes after she incited backlash Friday as a guest on "The View" by calling anti-abortion conservatives "hypocrites" during her appearance and admitting she believed in a woman's right to an abortion. "I'm pro-choice," she said, "and here's why: I can't sit here and be a hypocrite and say I'm for limited government but I think that the government should decide what women should do with their bodies." Glenn Beck, founder of TheBlaze TV, made it clear on his talk-radio show Monday morning that he disapproved of her commentary. "It takes intellectual honesty and a willingness to actually think these things through and to do more than just read Twitter and Facebook to get your news and opinions," he said. The "intellectual honesty" critique stemmed from Beck's tweet at Lahren on Sunday night: Lahren had this to say on Monday morning: Twitter has had mixed feelings about the suspension news: Tomi Lahren got suspended yay.. but she got suspended for believing in pro-choice.. which is weird Lahren did not immediately respond to a Huffington Post request for comment.
