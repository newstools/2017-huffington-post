Never underestimate Chrissy Teigen’s super-sleuthing skills. Twitter user @aleashofkeys, also known as “aj,” tried to secretly insult the 31-year-old model in a tweet by censoring Teigen’s name with asterisks ― but things didn’t go as planned. Chr*ssy T*ig*n is.....*looks both ways*beginning to annoy me In an act of apparent wizardry, Teigen replied to the subtweet Thursday night, daring “aj” unfollow her. Her clap back left Teigen’s fans baffled. Many people wondered how Teigen was able to uncover “aj’s” insult. Others were straight-up afraid of her tweet-finding skills. “How did you even see this,” one Twitter user asked. “Are you God?” You should *looks both ways* unfollow me https://t.co/idOa41E4Sx @chrissyteigen how did you even see this are you God @aleashofkeys You thought censoring her name would keep you safe from Queen Chrissy pic.twitter.com/3U7nQdDJ90 @chrissyteigen Didn't tag you, blocked out letters in your name, yet you still got her! pic.twitter.com/7ti0KfJGNE @chrissyteigen 😂 so scared of you that not only did she subtweet you, she did it without vowels!

She just has very loyal fans. “People tag me with the shit talking they see!” she tweeted. “I am bored but not that bored.” People tag me with the shit talking they see! I am bored but not that bored. https://t.co/XtNesTOjwQ Moral of the story: Don’t even try to hide from the queen of Twitter because her fans will find you.
