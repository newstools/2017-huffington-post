H&M's latest Conscious Exclusive collection proves that fashion may fade, but sustainable style is here to stay. Made for special occasions in mind, the line is made from at least 50 percent of recyclable and renewable materials. Available online and in stores from 20 April 2017, Natalia Vodianova, supermodel and face of the campaign, shared this dreamy video from behind the scenes on Instagram: –Ø –≥–æ—Ä–∂—É—Å—å —Ç–µ–º, —á—Ç–æ —Å—Ç–∞–Ω—É (Engl below) –ª–∏—Ü–æ–º —ç–∫–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–Ω–æ–π –ª–∏–Ω–∏–∏ H&M Conscious Exclusive. –£–≤–ª–µ–∫–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ –Ω–∞–±–ª—é–¥–∞—Ç—å –∑–∞ –ø–æ—è–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ–º –Ω–æ–≤—ã—Ö —ç–∫–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–Ω—ã—Ö –º–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–∞–ª–æ–≤, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–µ –∏—Å–ø–æ–ª—å–∑–æ–≤–∞–Ω—ã –≤ —ç—Ç–æ–π –∫–æ–ª–ª–µ–∫—Ü–∏–∏ - –æ–Ω–∏ –æ–±–µ—â–∞—é—Ç –Ω–∞–º –±–æ–ª–µ–µ —ç–∫–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–Ω–æ–µ –±—É–¥—É—â–µ–µ –≤ –º–∏—Ä–µ –º–æ–¥—ã. –≠—Ç–æ –ø–ª–∞—Ç—å–µ, –Ω–∞–ø—Ä–∏–º–µ—Ä, –±—ã–ª–æ —Å–¥–µ–ª–∞–Ω–æ –∏–∑ –ø–µ—Ä–µ—Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–∞–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –ø–ª–∞—Å—Ç–∏–∫–æ–≤—ã—Ö –±—É—Ç—ã–ª–æ–∫, —Å–æ–±—Ä–∞–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö —Å –±–µ—Ä–µ–≥–æ–≤—ã—Ö –ª–∏–Ω–∏–π. @hm #HMConsciousExclusive üåäüå±‚ù§Ô∏è üá¨üáß I am proud to announce that I am starring this years' #HMConsciousExclusive campaign @hm !
