On this Sunday's episode of "Keeping Up with the Kardashians," Kim Kardashian will open up for the first time about about being robbed at gunpoint in Paris last October. In a new clip released on Wednesday, the 36-year-old reality star details how she believes the robbers planned their attack while she was staying at the No Address Hotel on Oct. 3. "So if you wait across the street, you can see the lights on because we're the first floor. So they must have been told we're the first floor," she told her sisters Kourtney and Khloe, adding that the robbers were "definitely" watching them and waited and until she turned the light off and went upstairs. Kim further explains that after constantly thinking about it, she believes that a group of men were likely following the family the entire trip. "I was Snapchatting that I was home and that everyone was going out. So I think they knew that [our bodyguard] Pascal was out with Kourtney and that I was [at the hotel] by myself," she said. "They had to have known we were leaving [Paris] that day. They had this window of opportunity and they just went for it." Kardashian was bound and gagged by her assailants, who placed her in a bathtub before making off with millions of dollars' worth of jewelry. In an emotional trailer for the 13th season of "KUWTK," Kim recounts the ordeal to her sisters, telling them she thought to herself, "They're gonna shoot me in the back. There's no way out. It makes me so upset to think about it." In January, French police charged four people in connection with robbery.
