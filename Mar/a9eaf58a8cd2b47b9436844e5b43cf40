The Economic Freedom Fighters on Friday called for background checks on taxi drivers, as more survivors of rapes in taxis came forward. According to reports on Thursday, a gang of men in Johannesburg were using a Quantum minibus taxi to pose as a legitimate taxi, and then raped women who got on board. In one case, a woman was raped for more than four hours while her son was forced to watch. The EFF on Friday condemned the attacks and called on the South African National Taxi Council (Santaco) to start "aggressive" background checks on its drivers. In a statement, the party said it was a fact that young black women endured "massive abuse and sexual harassment that they have grown too tired of reporting in our taxi ranks and industry spaces." "In fact, the government of the ANC has normalised this violence against women by not treating the treacherous acts and reports of sexual violence with urgency and precision. This in turn enforces normalised sexual violence against women and in particular, black women."
