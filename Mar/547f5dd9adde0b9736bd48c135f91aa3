Me: i don't really care about power rangers
New power rangers movie: *yellow ranger is a gay latina and blue is black and autistic*
Me: pic.twitter.com/i2Y1NsnjO1 #PowerRangersMovie has Blue Ranger that is autistic and Yellow Ranger that is gay. I like this. It's indicative of real people/challenges. power rangers has a gay character and 6-year-old me is LIVING dc and marvel honestly wish their movies were as amazing and diverse as power rangers and those are facts POWER RANGERS GOT A LESBIAN LATINA, AN AUTISTIC BLACK BOY, A KICKASS DESI GIRL AND A BUFF CHINESE GUY SO I BEST BE SEEING YOU AT THE MOVIES pic.twitter.com/FOKRGSVgBz
