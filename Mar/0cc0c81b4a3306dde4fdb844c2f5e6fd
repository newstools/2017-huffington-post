J.K. Rowling launched a pre-emptive strike against Twitter trolls on Wednesday. As the world geared up to mark International Women's Day, the Harry Potter author anticipated the trash-tweeters who'd try to belittle the event by asking why there wasn't a corresponding celebration for men: Happy #InternationalWomensDay

or, as it's often called on here, #WhyIsn'tThereAnInternationalMensDay

(There is: November 19th) Predictably, Rowling's post received a mixed reaction and enticed some of the trolls to come out of hiding. Here are some of her followers' favorable replies: @jk_rowling pic.twitter.com/MJs2jzg3Ws @jk_rowling I thought International Men's day was 364 days long! @jk_rowling @margarance pic.twitter.com/7Bb9j5Wisu @jk_rowling But isn't international men's day everyday except for today? Rowling also recommended some reading for her followers in honor of the day, which applauds achievements of women whilst campaigning for a gender equal world: Some great pieces to read on #InternationalWomensDay, the first from @Okwongahttps://t.co/DAmnkD0VQn This, from @redlightvoices, is a must read on 'alt-feminism' in the age of Trump.#InternationalWomensDay https://t.co/o4Iy0NvY81 Oh, and this, by @caitlinmoran, is fab too.#InternationalWomensDay https://t.co/etbjTVx57f This Women's History Month, remember that we have the power to make history every day.
