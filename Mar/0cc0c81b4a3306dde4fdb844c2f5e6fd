J.K. Rowling launched a pre-emptive strike against Twitter trolls on Wednesday. As the world geared up to mark International Women's Day, the Harry Potter author anticipated the trash-tweeters who'd try to belittle the event by asking why there wasn't a corresponding celebration for men: Predictably, Rowling's post received a mixed reaction and enticed some of the trolls to come out of hiding.
