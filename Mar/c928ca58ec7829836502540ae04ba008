Is there another One? There could be. According to The Hollywood Reporter, a reboot of “The Matrix” is in the early stages of development at Warner Bros. The Wachowski siblings, who wrote and directed the original trilogy, will not be involved in the reboot. However, the studio is hoping for their blessing. THR also cited sources saying Zak Penn, who worked on several Marvel films, was in talks to write a treatment, and Michael B. Jordan was being eyed to star. It’s not clear what role, if any, the original cast may have. Keanu Reeves, who portrayed Neo, told Yahoo! Movies last month that he’d be interested in returning to the franchise but “the Wachowskis would have to be involved.” The trilogy also starred Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus and Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity. “The Matrix” was released in 1999 and followed by a pair of sequels in 2003. The three films grossed $1.6 billion worldwide, according to Box Office Mojo. Needless to say, fans of the beloved franchise had mixed feelings about the news: "THE MATRIX reboot in the works" pic.twitter.com/Z1I7tGBbj1 Not sure why everyone is pissed about a #Matrix TV reboot. That world has potential for some amazing storytelling. Endless possibilities. I realize complaining about a Matrix reboot is serious 'old man shouting at cloud' territory but that cloud is awful and get off my lawn A "reboot" of The Matrix? I say bring it on! I was really into the movies a few years ago. I would love a reboot. #TheMatrix #dodgethis pic.twitter.com/EnlotnhuQa A reboot of the "The Matrix"?! without the Wachowskis... please no... no.
