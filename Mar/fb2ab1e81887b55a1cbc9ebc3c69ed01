Zulaikha Patel, the Pretoria High School For Girls pupil who fought against the school's discriminatory hair policies last year, has gained global fame. She's become something of a symbol for the struggle against systemic racism â€” in this case, in South Africa's schools. Her stance inspired street artist Lexi Bella to create a big mural of Patel on Flushing Avenue in Brooklyn, New York. @zulaikha.patel.with.thee.afro my #ZulaikhaPatel still giving us hope on #Flushing @thebushwickcollective A post shared by Lexi Bella (@lexibellaart) on Feb 18, 2017 at 2:05pm PST  Profoundness comes in many forms and @lexibellaart is such a classy example. A BIG thank you for taking the time to meet with our class and even answer our questions. There was more than enough to learn from her including a humorous story of her #zulaikhapatel mural being complimented by the actual Zulaikha Patel. Just like how it was special for her to talk to an inspirational figure like Zulaikha, it was special for me to get to talk to Lexi.

The artist has created many political murals, including one of Wonder Woman punching Donald Trump. #IWishIPaintedThis Wonder women of the world we have to continue to rise up against the fascism in our government and the PIG of a human we have allowed to take charge. from @theaboutblank (if anyone knows who the artist is please tag them!)
