Since Alec Baldwin began impersonating Donald Trump on "Saturday Night Live," the long-running sketch show has enjoyed its best ratings in six years. But his performance might be more short-lived than fans hoped. The actor blamed the Trump administration's "maliciousness" on his reluctance to continue playing the president. As Baldwin told Extra's Mario Lopez, Trump hasn't cooled down the way he thought he would after taking office. "His policies aside, which you can hate, I thought he would have just relaxed," Baldwin said. "The maliciousness of this White House has people worried, which is why I'm not going to do it much longer, the impersonation. I don't know how much more people can take it." Baldwin debuted his stellar Trump impression in October, and has since revealed that he did not prepare at all before showing up to rehearse the first sketch for series creator Lorne Michaels. "Trump just overwhelmingly lacks any kind of sportsmanship. He remains bitter and angry. And you just want to look at him and go, 'You won!'" Baldwin told Extra. The actor's portrayal has repeatedly prompted angry tweets from Trump. In another blow, it also doesn't appear there's much chance we'll see Baldwin host the White House Correspondents Dinner in place of Trump, who has said he does not plan to attend. The actor doesn't think organizers would appreciate it. "If Trump himself doesn't come and face the music, as it were, I don't know what kind of program they're going to have. If they wanted me to do it, I would probably do it," Baldwin said. "But I'm not quite sure they'll do. I think they may have a whole other idea."
