George Michael died of natural causes, according to the coroner's report released on Tuesday. Specifically, the "Careless Whisper" singer suffered from dilated cardiomyopathy with myocarditis and a fatty liver, senior coroner for Oxfordshire, Darren Salter told the Press Association. George was found dead at his Oxfordshire home on Christmas Day last year at the age of 53. In an additional statement, the star's publicist said: "It is with great sadness that we can confirm our beloved son, brother and friend George passed away peacefully at home over the Christmas period. Plans for the singer's funeral are now expected to get underway. Last month, George's former Wham! bandmate Andrew Ridgeley spoke of the pain his family and friends had suffered because of the delay in giving him their final farewell. "We've not had closure. It's difficult for me," he said. "It's difficult for everyone. It's a limbo period and we need to be able to move on."
