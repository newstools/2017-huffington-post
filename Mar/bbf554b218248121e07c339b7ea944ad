They may seem like an unlikely pair, but Michelle Obama and former President George W. Bush have a warm, genuine friendship with one another. "That surprised everybody," Bush told Ellen DeGeneres on a recent episode of "Ellen." "That's what so weird about society today. People on opposite sides of the political spectrum could actually like each other." Yet, the reason why the two get along so well is pretty simple: Bush makes Obama laugh. "She kind of likes my sense of humor. Anybody who likes my sense of humor, I immediately like," Bush told People while promoting his new book, "Portraits of Courage," which features his paintings of military veterans. Bush explained to the magazine that he and former first lady were often seated next to each other at events such as an interfaith memorial service for Texas police officers in July and Nancy Reagan's memorial service in March 2016. "I can't remember where else I've sat next to her, but I probably have a few wise cracks and she seemed to like it okay," he told People. "I needle her a little bit and around her, I'm fairly lighthearted. [The Obamas] are around serious people all the time and we just took to each other." The two also sat next to each other at the opening dedication ceremony of the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture in September 2016. The photos of the two of at this particular event went viral. When asked about the pals' vibe in these photos, Bush told People: "When I saw her, it was a genuine expression of affection." Aw shucks, you guys!
