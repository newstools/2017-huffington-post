Get ready to watch the inevitable reality show "North and Saint Take On Acapulco" because even though "Keeping Up with the Kardashians" is on life support, ratings-wise, this family has no plans of slowing down any time soon. As of late, the Kardashian flagship series has been documenting the aftermath of Kim Kardashian's robbery, but in the preview for next week's episode, the reality star shares some uplifting news: She wants another baby. "I'm going to try to have one more baby," the reality star says in the promo. "I want my kids to have siblings but the doctors don't feel like it's safe for me." Although Kardashian has long expressed her desire to have a big family, the promo clip is the first time the "Kimoji" creator has publicly revealed she's actually trying to have baby. No. 3. After giving birth to daughter North, 3, and Saint, 1, doctors warned Kardashian of the dangers of another high-risk pregnancy. She suffered from preeclampsia, as well as a life-threatening condition called placenta accreta during her first pregnancy and experienced labor complications while delivering her second child. Kardashian has openly discussed using a surrogate for her next child to avoid further complications from another pregnancy. In the clip, Kardashian's mom, Kris Jenner, expresses her concern over the prospect of her daughter giving birth again, telling Kim, "I don't want you to do something that puts you in danger."
