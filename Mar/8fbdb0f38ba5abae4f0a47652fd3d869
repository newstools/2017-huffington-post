Recently, Junaid Jahangir wrote a blog arguing that Muslim women can marry outside the faith. Junaid quoted 10 modern-day authorities and mentioned that Universalist Muslims and a few other organizations who are seated outside the traditional Islamic establishment, serve the Muslim community by connecting interfaith couples, who consist of Muslim women and non-Muslim men, to Muslim officiants who conduct their Islamic nikkah, or wedding ceremony.

Did Junaid receive criticism? Of course. There were Muslim women who reprimanded Junaid -- a man -- for taking the initiative to speak about what they regarded as a women's issue. And there were Muslim men who scolded him for quoting authorities -- whom they claimed were either misinterpreted or who misinterpreted Islam themselves.
Well, the critics don't speak for all of us.
In particular, they don't speak for the multitude of single Muslim women here in North America who know that finding a single and suitable Muslim man within reasonable driving distance of one's home is like finding a needle in a haystack.
That is not to say hot, single, smart Muslim men don't exist. They do. But because the traditional mosque permits Muslim men to marry outside the faith, some of our (usually more liberal) Muslim brothers fall in love and marry compatible women outside Islam.
How could they?
Easily. Studies show people more likely fall in love and end up with partners who live or work in close proximity to them. It means it is more probable for a great single Muslim guy to fall in love with his non-Muslim co-worker, classmate or neighbour than his parents' friends' adult Muslim daughter who lives on the other side of town, or in another town altogether.
