Yesterday South Africans woke up to the sad news that legendary actor and entertainer Joe Mafela died tragically in a car accident. The youngsters may have known him for his very recent role as Tebogo Moroka on "Generations — The Legacy" but some oldies know him for what we've known as his first popular role as S'dumo on "'Sgudi 'Snaysi". He was a muVenḓa man, born in Sibasa, Limpopo who grew up in Soweto and spoke all 11 official languages in South Africa. Multilingual and multi-talented, it's no wonder tributes are pouring in his fans and from actors young and old, those who worked with him and those who didn't, who admired Mafela for his contribution to the film and television industry and to entertainment as a whole. 1. Thembi Mtshali-Jones played Sis' Thoko on "'Sgudi 'Snaysi" with Mafela. 2. Actress Florence Masebe lauded Mafela for inspiring young vhaVenḓa people through his work.   3. TV host Hulisani Ravele shared her favourite Mafela roles.  4. Actress Thando Thabethe worked with Mafela on "Generations — The Legacy". When you are given the opportunity to MEET let alone WORK with someone you grew up watching as a child, THAT is a privilege. To say it was an Honor Mkhulu to work with you is down playing just how much it has meant to me. I will miss your humor, humility, kindness, patience, wisdom!!! I don't get this death thing, but ya here we are...RIP Mkhulu 💔💔 I'm sad today very sad A post shared by Thando Thabethe (@thando_thabethe) on Mar 19, 2017 at 6:22am PDT   5. Sdumo Mtshali shared what it's like to carry the weight of Mafela's character's name. #RIPJoeMafela When I met him for the first time, my heart couldn't stop beating.. he's been apart my life more than anyone could ever know!

Actress TKay Kaula shared a clip of Mafela as Jabulani Cebekhulu on "Going Up". "Hello, Jabulani Cebekhulu Translater For The New South Africa And All Its Regions Yes Can I Help You?" 😂😭 Watching your work everyday at work because you are basically our entire content! Wow what a man. We can never forget you. We will keep your legacy alive. #JoeMafela #RIPJoeMafela #Comedian #Actor #Legend #Going Up #SgudiSnaysi #Mbungulu #Jabulani #Sdumo #SABCEncore #SABC #Channel156 A post shared by TKay Kaula (@tkaula) on Mar 20, 2017 at 1:28am PDT  7. Producer and actress Mmabatho Montsho broke down the reason Sdumo was such an important role to her. He did many other notable works throughout his career, but his portrayal of S'dumo stands out for most of us. This character defined an era in so many ways. He played this character with not only humor, but with selflessness and compassion. A true storyteller understands the humor in tragedy and tragedies in humor. Every storyteller dreams of that one unforgettable piece of work that touches hearts from small child to grandparent- you achieved that. You inspire many of us. Go well ntate Joe Mafela. RIP.

Actress Nomzamo Mbatha shared a fond memory of Mafela from his birthday two years ago. I posted the above TWO years ago on his birthday. An absolute privilege and the highest honour. Eternally. #RIPJoeMafela The truest meaning of a legend. SA's original King of Comedy!!! A post shared by Nomzamo Mbatha 🇿🇦 (@nomzamo_m) on Mar 19, 2017 at 10:17pm PDT  11. Like Mafela, Siyabonga Radebe is an actor and comedian. He shared this on family and Sdumo. The character of Sdumo that Joe Mafela created for Sgudi'snice gave a suffering people a sweet moment of escaping reality. No matter what was going on outside the house, people said we will deal with it when we finish watching Sdumo. Joe Mafela made every ghetto smile at the same time. I mimicked and repeated every joke from Sgudi'snice. The Sdumo character showed a beautiful life of a man struggling to make a living, hustling to stay alive with nothing of his own. That's how he won the love of the country. We recognized him, almost every one outside, was just like him. #rip #joemafela you won the hearts of the young and the old alike and that's why you will never be forgotten.
