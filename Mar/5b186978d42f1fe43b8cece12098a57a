The Cape Cycle Tour was cancelled on Sunday morning due to extreme wind. The organisers cancelled it early on Sunday for safety reasons, pulling riders off the road.  The first riders had already started so they had to be taken off the route.   The organisers had earlier warned that wind was expected. "We, at the Cape Town Cycle Tour, are doing our best wind dances to keep the Cape Doctor at bay," said the organisers on the official Cape Town Cycle Tour website. Cape roads were reopened and the cycle facilities closed down.  All food from today's cancelled @CTCycleTour hospitality & waterpoints will be donated to #HoutBayFire victims. #CycleTour2017pic.twitter.com/CklZN5xFaM  The organisers said safety considerations ruled.
