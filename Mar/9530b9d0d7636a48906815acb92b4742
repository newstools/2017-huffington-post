Being sexy has no age limit. Fifty-six-year-old model Mercy Brewer proves that, starring in a lingerie campaign for Lonely, a body-positive brand that’s based in New Zealand. The new campaign is a part of the label’s ongoing “Lonely Girls” series, which has featured Lena Dunham and Jemima Kirke. Brewer, a self-described former punk, once modeled alongside Naomi Campbell and Kate Moss. She was a perfect fit for the brand, according to Helene Morris, one of Lonely’s co-founders and designers. “At Lonely, we feel that it is important to challenge what we see in our media with a more authentic reflection of beauty and hope to grow people’s visual vocabulary,” Morris said in statement about the series. “The beauty and fashion industries are so obsessed with youth, but the reality is we are all aging, and there are so many wonderful things about growing older.” Brewer told i-D magazine that she was a fan of the lingerie brand before she started modeling for them. The model describes her appearance in the ad campaign as a way to bring “recognition that older women can kick ass when the opportunity arises.” “Forget stereotypes, if someone looks good in your gear, shine a light on them,” she said.
