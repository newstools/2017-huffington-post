DJ Black Coffee has been the name everyone's been talking about, from featuring in U.S. rapper Drake's new album to several punts from big names for his house music throughout last week. Over and above that, Black Coffee has also been praised for his humility and heart for helping others in the industry. In the highly competitive music industry in which survival is largely dependent on self-promotion among other factors, Black Coffee's humility and willingness to open up opportunities for others in the industry is wonderfully refreshing. Local DJ Euphonic had this to say of Black Coffee's generosity: "If you're African please go to bed today comprehending that Black Coffee hasn't only opened the door for us. He kicked it wide open." If ur African please go to bed today comprehending that @RealBlackCoffee hasn't only opened the door for us. He kicked it wide open. 🙏🏾 pic.twitter.com/jX2BeeiEj6 This Tweet had been retweeted 4,400 times.

He not only recorded with her but also punted her name which opened up doors for her, too. Black Coffee is flying high.
