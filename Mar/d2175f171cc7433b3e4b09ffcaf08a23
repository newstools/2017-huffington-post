After the Minister Of State Security David Mahlobo said that capped restrictions on the type of content that is released to the media would be regulated, #HandsOffSocialMedia was the top trend in South Africa. Apparently the reasoning to this decision was led by the amount of fake news that is published online and the photoshopped pictures leaked to the media. Twitter then fired back saying the ANC is hiding behind fickle reasons in order to push their own agendas. These are some of the reasons why the ANC wants this rule implemented: It is quite obvious that the ANC is trying to destroy the voice of the youth the same way the apartheid government oppressed black people and crippled them from speaking up. The impacts of regulations on media could cause any potential investors from overseas to think twice about approaching South Africa because of the limited content that can be released. People who make a living from social media will have to find another source of income because of the lack of business that will be available. The ANC fails to keep up with the times and they continue to abuse the constitution. When is enough really enough?
