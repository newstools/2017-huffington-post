Maybe you’re already into yoga. Maybe you think it’s not your style. The truth is that yoga is for everyone ― no matter your size, age or religious preference. Don’t believe us? Scroll through our favorite yoga Instagram accounts. They’ll inspire you to hit the mat and reap the health benefits of the practice, which include reduced stress, increased physical activity and and lower risk of chronic disease. Check out the list below: Eka para sirsasana. One foot to head seat. This is a great party trick. But, be careful. You really need to warm up the hips with external rotation such as pigeon and cobblers with forward bends. Practicing poses that really round the spine, like cat and rabbit poses are also good. Try a lunge and work the shoulder underneath the front thigh and maybe contemplate getting your head behind the calf. It's fun. Go slowly and remember our motto @TheYogaShanti... "any amount". 🙏🏼😊 #focusfriday A post shared by C O L L E E N • S A I D M A N (@colleensaidman) on Dec 16, 2016 at 6:44pm PST Colleen Saidman Yee is an author and international yoga instructor.

There was a great article my friend @themilitantbaker wrote for @ravishly recently talking about gaining weight. This made me think back to January 2014 when I was practicing yoga the most and felt my most active with biking and practicing. Since then I've definitely gained a lot of the weight back which I'm content with. A lot has happened since then. As Jes had talked about in her article, everything is always consisting changing, one year we can have more time for things, and other years things can take up your time. I know I always get those comments asking why I haven't lost any weight after practicing yoga for the last 5 years. I've never used my practice as a source of weight lose. I personally don't think it should be used for that just because there are so many other elements to practicing yoga. I lost most of my weight back in 2014 because I was biking, which is what I believe was the source of my weight loss, though the reason I biked was because it made me feel free and happy. Losing weight just happened to be a by-product. I've consistently advocated to just do active things just for the enjoyment of it, and not have to obsess about how many pounds you've lost. The more you obsess, the more expectation you put on yourself. That if you didn't do your physical activity something extremely bad will happen to you. Don't worry you'll be fine! You don't need to beat yourself up about it. Those extra pounds are okay! Be content with your body whether you have time for physical activities or life has to happen. We all have complicated lives. When you know you have the drive and time come back to it and be appreciative of yourself.

Their Instagram feed is full of posts from these travels. Next up? Koh-Samui, Thailand in July. Take us with you, please? I almost cried during my interview with @selfmagazine when they asked about my experience with self hate- honestly, it's bizarre to me that I'm perceived as such a confident person when I spent such a huge chunk of my life buried under truly toxic body shame. And it's not like those feelings have completely dissipated- just like anyone, I have ups and downs. And I always roll my eyes whenever people draw the conclusion that yoga is the source of my body confidence. I mean, Instagram is littered with proof that an aggressive yoga asana practice can unintentionally sow the seeds of body negativity. But there's no doubt that yoga has made me stronger- but the physical strength isn't really the point, is it?

Stanley is a certified yoga instructor based in North Carolina with a fierce body-positive attitude. Her book, Every Body Yoga, will be published in April 2017. When things get a little crazy in your life where do you turn for peace, for clarity, for wisdom? What grounds you and illuminates your best course of action? _ For me, it's always nature.  Mother Nature has a way of calming the storm (whether it's inside me or outside of me) and creating space for me to see clearly. It allows me a buffer zone to feel into the absolute best course of action to take for me. And to realize that sometimes my path might be very different than those around me. _ Now is a time for wisdom.  Now is a time for clarity. Now is the time for you to gather your faculties and walk down YOUR path.  Stand up for what you believe in the ways that ring true for you.  But stand up either way.  Take action either way.  Do this with love, and compassion.  For others and for yourself.
