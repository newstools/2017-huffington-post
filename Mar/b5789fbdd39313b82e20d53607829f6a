Tito Mboweni is trending on Twitter and iTunes charts, but it's not because the man who used to sign our money has gone into the music game. Cassper Nyovest has dropped his latest single "Tito Mboweni" and people are going a little crazy.  Within minutes of availability "Tito Mboweni" Was topping the iTunes hip-hop list and soon, took the overall number one spot and of course Nyovest's fans are going to milk this moment for all it's worth.  Last week Friday Tito Mboweni, yes the actual owner of the name, joked that Nyovest did not ask him to use his name and now he wasn't getting royalties. Hey wena Cassper, how do you produce a song about someone with without negotiating first. I am a banker, expect an invoice tomorrow. So who best to get negotiations done? Mboweni called on his good friend Julius Malema to make things happen. To which "Juju" obliged.    Those who don't know, this is the reason for negotiations! Juju, hurry up before Friday. Urgent! pic.twitter.com/TysirACBIO  Somewhere between these tweets of urgency, a phone call was made and the deal was sealed. Mboweni gave us his blessing to jam to his name. Juju has fulfilled the task. @CassperNyovest has made contact with me.Khotso! Pula! Nala! Let the Youth dance and rejoice!Yours is the time!  We're thinking this video Mboweni retweeted of Redi Tlhabi dancing before her Radio 702 show, is all the inspiration we need to get the moves right. Ladies and gentlemen...that's how we start the #AfternoonDrive with @RediTlhabi on @Radio702 ðŸ™Œ pic.twitter.com/Hv2s71T4dW  What have we learned from Mboweni's negotiation tactics? Stay awoke guys! I said "Awoke" not "Awake". Young people understand "Awoke". It's a Twitter lingo! Old people, please be "Awoke"!! No! to the hatred!!
