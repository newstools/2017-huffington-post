The board of the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) has been fired, reported The Times on Wednesday. "We have been fired," said a board member in Parliament, reported The Times. The board was briefing the parliamentary portfolio committee on transport. The board was criticised by the committee on Tuesday for bad management. It has been in conflict with the acting Prasa CEO, Collins Letsoalo, himself fired by the board after allegedly awarding himself a 350 percent pay increase and publicly saying the board had approved it, which the board said it hadn't. Eyewitness News and Power FM radio stations also reported that the board had been fired.
