It is unclear if struggle stalwart Winnie Madikizela-Mandela will be discharged from hospital on Friday, her spokesperson Victor Dlamini told News24 on Friday morning. Madikizela-Mandela was admitted to the Milpark Hospital in Johannesburg on Wednesday. Dlamini said he visited her on Thursday night. "She was fine, she was well. I will see her this morning to give a more detailed update." Madikizela-Mandela was at the hospital for a routine check when her doctors recommended that she stay overnight for observation, he said. Dlamini was unable to provide any additional information. Madikizela-Mandela was admitted to the hospital briefly in December for observation. In April last year, she was in hospital after undergoing back surgery. News24
