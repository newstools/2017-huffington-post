When Robert Keane learned he could no longer go on a long-awaited trip with his best friend Paddy James, he figured the least he could do was find a substitute to travel with James in his place. The 27-year-old from Sydney, Australia posted James' photo in a backpackers' Facebook group, asking members if they'd be willing to accompany his friend on their pre-planned journey up Australia's coast. The thing is, though, that James is arguably a bit more attractive than your average traveler. His photos were shirtless. And the responses flooded in. James promptly started receiving messages and comments from travelers around the globe after the post went live, he told The Huffington Post. Commenters are offering to travel with him, host them in their hometowns and even take him on dates. He's received about 150 messages so far. "All of the messages have been from girls," the 23-year-old said. "The girl wanting to take me to Vegas and marry me was quite funny." James plans to start his trip Saturday in Sydney and work his way up the coast, hitting spots like Byron Bay, Brisbane, Noosa and the Whitsunday Islands. He may meet up with some of the women who messaged him, he said, however, he didn't replace Keane with a consistent travel companion. He'll be traveling for one month â€• just enough time to book a flight, if you're into such things.
