How's a girl to unwind after slaying the red carpet at another Oscars night? If you're Halle Berry, you peel off your Atelier Versace dress in slow-motion on Twitter to Bruno Mars' "Versace on the Floor" â€• and jump in the pool. Berry, still the first and only woman of color to win for Best Actress, looked as cool as ever. Hope she made sure not to splash chlorine on that gown. After a long award show a girl can't wait to take it off!@brunomars #24kmagic pic.twitter.com/3TfwsV4kZ0 staff
