Last year, the Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) filed charges of perjury against him, after he failed to show that the decision to put e-tolls on the N1 and N2 in the Western Cape was a decision of the board, and not his alone. Peters' decision comes after the ousted Prasa chairman Popo Molefe filed an urgent application before the High Court in Johannesburg to have the dissolution of the board declared unlawful. The minister's action interfere with an ongoing investigation into R14 billion of fruitless, wasteful and irregular expenditure that was uncovered, the documents say.
