Professional Guitar Sadboi Ed Sheeran will make a cameo on the seventh and final season of Game of Thrones. The show creators D.B. Weiss and David Benioff confirmed this at a SXSW panel on Sunday. Apparently the reason why the famous Vetkoek Impersonator will get an appearance on the show is because Maisie Williams (who plays on Arya Stark) is a massive fan of his music, and the producers worked for years to make it happen as a surprise to her. No word yet on the role that the Fire-Haired Crooner will portray. Sigur RÃ³s, Coldplay's Will Champion and Of Monsters And Men got musical roles when they appeared, while members of Mastodon were unrecognisable as the shuffled around onscreen as the dreaded White Walkers.
