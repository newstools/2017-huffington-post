"New African Magazine" has revealed its 100 most influential Africans of 2017 and South Africa is very well represented. The list, which features the fifth highest number of female Africans in its history, is spread over nine categories: politics and public service; business and finance; civil society and activism; education; science, technology and innovation; media; arts and culture; and sport. It profiles people living in the continent and the African diaspora, nominated by their peers and industry insiders. With 21 entries, Nigeria tops the nominations, but it is closely followed by South Africa which scored 14 names. Among the winners there's a deafblind Harvard University law graduate activist, an attitude-changing teen dance troop from a Ugandan slum, and a Mauritanian modern-day slavery abolitionist hero. "Our criteria for 'influential' this year was a fairly simple one â€“ it is applied to people whose work or activity has had some sort of transformative effect outside their main calling," explained Anver Versi, the magazine's editor. "This effect results in a change of perception or provides inspiration to others. Many in our selection have shattered the proverbial glass-ceilings or disability stigma and do so with great bravery, determination and personal sacrifice. Others yield economic power that impacts world markets." He added: "African talent in the arts, culture, sports and technology has also has a huge impact on changing the world's perception towards Africa and its people." Here's South Africa's most influential Africans: 1. Pravin Gordhan Political stalwart, anti-corruption campaigner and former finance minister.
