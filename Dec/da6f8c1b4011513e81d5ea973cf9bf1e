Will the “Avengers” series end for good, or will it take a new form after “Infinity Wars” and the as-of-yet unnamed fourth film?  Marvel heads have hinted that even revealing the title of the fourth “Avengers” film would be a spoiler, leading some to believe that we will one day be getting a new Avengers team altogether. On Friday, “Nerdist News” host Jessica Chobot laid out why a “Back To The Future” -esque time travel plot could create a new group of Avengers while connecting the remaining unconnected dots of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Great Scott!
