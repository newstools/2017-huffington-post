911 call centres undoubtedly deal with a deluge of calls that aren't actually emergencies. But even for them, some calls really stand out. E-Comm, B.C.'s largest 911 call centre, released a list of 2017's top reasons not to call 911 —based on actual calls they've received — that is hilarious and baffling in equal measure. 


                                                                            


    
      So without further ado, please do not call 911 for the following reasons: It's important to remember that calling 911 with nuisance calls can tie up lines and make it harder for people to get in touch with dispatchers. "Spending time on calls like these takes me away from being available to help someone who is a serious emergency situation," Christie Duncan, an E-Comm call-taker, said. "And believe it or not, this isn't the first time I've received a call about the colour of nail polish." 


                                                                


    
      The 911 line is not a customer service or general information resource. It's a line for police, fire and medical emergencies. "While these calls are absurd, they're more common than you might think. The fact is – every time a 911 call-taker handles one of these calls, we waste valuable resources. We're asking the public to help us help," Jody Robertson, E-Comm's executive director of corporate communications, said.  E-Comm, which handles approximately 1.36 million calls a year, has a guide to help you figure out if you're dealing with an emergency. Please use it. Also on HuffPost:
