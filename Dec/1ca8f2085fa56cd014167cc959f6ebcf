It will be 2018 in just a few hours, and if you have your resolutions in place already, then great. If not, then you might want to read on. Twitter users have taken the responsibility of compiling a list of all the things people "cannot" take with them into the new year. South African Twitter has spoken, under the hashtag #ThingsToLeaveIn2017, and Donald Trump, Zuma, f*ckboys, ''hoerism", fake friends and being broke are among the top items on the list. If you missed it, here's what Twitter reckons we all need to make a fresh start on in 2018: 1. Apple, if you're listening, that autocorrect is not always cool, thanks:   2. We're done with cheaters in 2018:   3. What's the term again? Oh "fake friends":    4. If this is you, please change. There's hope for you in 2018:   5. Crushes that just won't do the "right thing". Mxm:  Why?  Happy New Year everybody! We hope you have a safe crossover and a prosperous 2018.
