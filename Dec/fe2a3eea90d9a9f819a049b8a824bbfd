ANALYSIS The ANC's provinces have completed their provincial general councils and Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa is leading Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, according to the number of nominations by branches. There is still a lot of lobbying and gerrymandering to take place before an approximate 5,200 ANC delegates converge on Nasrec next week, but a clearer picture is definitely starting to emerge -- and one in which Ramaphosa is better off than his opponent. 


                                                                


    
      In 2007, President Jacob Zuma claimed the support of six of the nine provincial general councils, with then-president Thabo Mbeki scalping three. Mbeki's campaigners were unperturbed, however, arguing that they have their strategies in place and that provincial mandates couldn't be taken at face value. They believed delegates would vote differently at conference than they did at branches or at the councils. They were wrong and Zuma beat Mbeki by roughly the same margin weeks later.
