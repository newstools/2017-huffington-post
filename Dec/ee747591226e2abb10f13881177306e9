Hollywood woke up early Monday to announce the nominees for the 75th annual Golden Globe Awards. Presenters Alfre Woodard, Garrett Hedlund, Kristen Bell and Sharon Stone revealed the newly minted honorees from film and television at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills, California. Tonya Harding pulled off the triple axel, but will Margot Robbie take home gold for her performance in “I, Tonya”? Or will Emma Stone build upon her awards momentum from last year and game, set, match the competition as Billie Jean King in “Battle of the Sexes”? Critically celebrated films like “Get Out,” “Call Me By Your Name” and “Dunkirk” are also expected to be recognized  On the TV side, HBO’s not-so-limited series “Big Little Lies” could dominate in its categories after a nearly clean Emmys sweep earlier this year. The Globes are also likely to recognize Elisabeth Moss and the rest of “The Handmaid’s Tale” after a stellar (and terrifying) debut season on Hulu. Of course, as always, expect to bow down to “The Crown.” The Globes, which honor the best in both movies and television, will air Jan. 7 on NBC, hosted by Seth Meyers.
