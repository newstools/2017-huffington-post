Following Solange's announcement that she would no longer perform at the Joburg leg of the Afropunk Festival on New Year's Eve, some ticket holders were left angry -- with many questioning why the organisers did not make the announcement earlier. Taking to Instagram, the "Cranes In The Sky" singer said she'd been treated for an autonomic disorder for the past five months. She also said doctors had not cleared her for travelling, which is why she pulled out of Afropunk, leaving many disappointed and angry.  But if you're still wondering why you should go to the festival, there's a host of local and international acts gearing up to entertain you at the event. Nandi Madida is the host.  And here's the full lineup (excluding Solange ðŸ˜¢ ): Saturday, December 30 Live and Direct: Anderson.Paak and The Free Nationals  Okzharp and Manthe Ribane Blitz The Ambassador TCIYF DOOKOOM Gods Sons and Daughters Thebe Sho Madjozi Stiff Pap Beats by: Black Motion DJ LAG and special guests Kid Fonque DJ Doowap The Alvhinator Tha Cutt Sunday, December 31 Live and Direct: King Tha vs BLK JKS Laura Mvula The Brother Moves On Nakhane Spoek Mathambo Petite Noir Urban Village Nonku Phiri Radio 123 Automatic Live Beats by: Theo Parrish DJ Kenzhero Anais B Just Themba Pussy Party DJs This year marks the first time that Afropunk will be hosted in Joburg, at Constitution Hill.
