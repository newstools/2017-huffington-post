­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­ Many of us are familiar with Cliff Richard's classic Christmas song, Mistletoe And Wine. The chorus goes something like this: "Christmastime, Mistletoe and wine, Children singing Christian rhymes. With logs on the fire and gifts on the tree, A time to rejoice in the good that we see." Christmastime is a few weeks away, department stores have been suitably decked out for over a month, and thousands of children are dreaming of family gatherings, delicious food and, of course, Santa Claus! Christmas is associated with the buying of gifts and, not unlike a shark feeding frenzy, it elicits a culture of must-buys and massive overspending. Unfortunately, gifts are equated with stuff -- toys, gadgets, computer games; the options are endless. This "stuff", in turn, is temporarily exciting to receive –– but that joy is short-lived. Soon, more stuff is demanded to fill the hole that is left. "Stuff" does not provide lasting fulfilment or long-term happiness! Think about it for a moment: Our children are being starved of positive human connections, uplifting fulfilling experiences and the opportunity to grow into leaders who embrace life to the fullest. It is time for a change of mindset when it comes to defining what gifts best serve our children during this holiday season. Here are a few novel, cost-effective gift ideas to consider: Christmastime is, indeed, the season for giving and sharing. By exploring some of the ideas above, you will add great value to this time –– and the rewards of increased happiness and fulfilment will be worth the effort.
