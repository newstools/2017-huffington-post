South Africans have been warned against extreme thunderstorms and widespread wildfires that are expected throughout the country on Monday. The South African Weather Service (SAWS) issued a red-alert for the Northern Cape, which warns against an imminent "severe weather hazard" within 24-hours, in anticipation of extremely high fire danger conditions for the central and eastern parts of the Northern Cape. Residents, the SAWS says, should take precautions. In addition, an amber-alert has been issued for the western and southern parts of the North West, extreme north-eastern Northern Cape, central and eastern Free State, extreme southern Highveld of Mpumalanga, and the western interior of KwaZulu-Natal, where a 60% chance of rain is forecast today.
