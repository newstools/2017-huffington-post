The ANC will be discussing issues surrounding the leaking of state information to journalists and other groups at the party's national conference in four days, said Energy Minister David Mahlobo. "There is a new phenomenon of people who are actually accessing information that they are not supposed to access, either wrongly or incorrectly, and it is a matter that you must be more worried [about]. For an example, information that lands in wrong hands, even to you as journalists," he said. Mahlobo, who forms part of the ANC NEC's subcommittee on peace and stability and is also the former head of the State Security Agency, was addressing the media on the committee's policy discussions for the conference. He was responding to questions on the use of intelligence to further political motives. "The integrity of people who must safeguard this information, we have a problem. We must be worried about the people working in the system... they must be able to live to their oath of office... it is one of the issues we are going to discuss," he said.  "This information that is actually obtained illegally, how does it get to be used? For character assassinations and dealing with each other. Lately you see a number of books, number of writings, things are substantiated and others are unsubstantiated... That's what we need to discuss." He said people working law enforcement agencies must "desist any temptation" to get involved in political affairs because their "duty is to remain apolitical".
