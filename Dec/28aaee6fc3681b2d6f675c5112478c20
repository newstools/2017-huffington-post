Yolandi Visser of Die Antwoord posted a video on her Instagram on Friday night blasting American rap superstar Eminem for mispronouncing the band's name in his latest single. In the third verse of Eminem's new song "Untouchable," he says: "I'd rather hear 'em say 'Die N-word' than Die Antwoord / Ninja, now it's better disguised banter." But the band made clear in a now-viral Instagram video that they weren't happy that the rapper mispronounced their name in an attempt to rhyme his lyrics. "Okay, so like, how would you feel if I called you Eeminem? Okay, your name's Eminem but I call you Eeminem, just because it rhymes with something you know." Then, Ninja -- the other half of the South-African-born rap duo -- went further and roasted Eminem back with his own rhyme: "Eeminemwent to jail and got a bit of semen in his bum and was never seen again," he jokes in the video.  A few minutes later Yolandi went back to Instagram to try and teach Eminem how to say their name correctly.  The band's fans were having a field day on the social media platform, laughing along, and berating Eminem. Listen to Eminem's latest track:
