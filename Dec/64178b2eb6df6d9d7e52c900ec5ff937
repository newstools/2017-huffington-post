It is the last week before the Christmas holidays and if you're still stuck in the office, then let us help maintain the illusion that you're working really hard. This new puzzle, created by illustrator Gergely Dud√°s is asking you to find the 'bear among the reindeer' in a Where's Wally? style scene. Clue, it is the one without the antlers on it's head. But, it's much harder than it sounds (especially on a festive hangover). You can scroll down for the answer if you're still struggling. The illustration is part of a whole book, called 'Bear's Merry Book of Hidden Things', which is available online.
