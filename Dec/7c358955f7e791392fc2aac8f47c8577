About 30,000 cases of precut vegetables are being recalled in many states because they could be contaminated with Listeria. But how, exactly, do these bacteria get into veggies? Listeria is found naturally in soil and water, and animals can carry the bacteria without appearing sick, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Raw vegetables can become contaminated with Listeria either through contact with soil or with animal manure that is used as fertilizer, according to the Mayo Clinic.

Unlike many other types of bacteria, Listeria can grow in the colder temperatures of refrigerators and freezers. "It's a pathogen that's particularly problematic in food-processing plants because it really likes cold, moist, dark environments," Benjamin Chapman, a food safety expert at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, told Live Science in a 2015 interview. Other foods that have been historically linked with Listeria outbreaks include raw milk, unpasteurized soft cheeses and deli meats, Chapman said. But Listeria infections can be serious, and even deadly, particularly for certain groups of people, including young children, pregnant women, the elderly and people with weakened immune systems. The infection can cause fever, muscle aches and diarrhea, and in pregnant women, it may cause miscarriage or stillbirth, the CDC says.
