Emotional Intelligence is like freshly squeezed orange juice. When you squeeze an orange, you expect orange juice to flow out of it. You wouldn't expect to find grape or peach juice inside an orange, because an orange only has orange juice to give. Human behavioural choices are based on what we have inside to give -- much like that orange. What we have inside is based on how we feel about ourselves as a person. And how we feel about ourselves as a person influences every choice we make. Every choice that we make defines the path of our lives. All negative behaviours are based on fear, low self-esteem, self-defeating and destructive self-talk, and low self-value. Consider, for a moment, how nobody who values and respects themselves would want to hurt another. The very act of self-value and self-respect ensures that they will give that out to others. This is the reason why it is so important to teach and enhance emotional intelligence skills in our children. Emotional intelligence is self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy and social skills all packed into one. Children who master emotional intelligence skills become better leaders, study more effectively, enjoy more fulfilling relationships with others, are better able to retain information, have better concentration skills and live happier, more fulfilled lives. In fact, schools that teach emotional intelligence skills even have fewer bullying incidents, and learning for all is more exciting, creative and effective.
