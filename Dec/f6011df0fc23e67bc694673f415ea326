Meghan Markle may not be a royal yet, but she’s already got a sense of style on par with her sister-in-law to be, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge. Markle’s style has evolved quite a bit over the years, going from laid-back California girl to prim and polished future member of the royal family. What we love most about the “Suits” star’s style is the fact that she’s not afraid to take risks, whether it be with a modern crop top, a studded biker jacket or a bold print. (We hope she gets to translate that into her royal wardrobe.)  In the mix with her edgier sartorial choices, of course, have been plenty of Kate Middleton-esque ensembles. And like the Duchess of Cambridge, Markle’s influence has the power to sell out clothing. It’s as if she’s meant to be a royal.  Over the coming months, all eyes will be on Markle as she prepares to wed Prince Harry. But before we start speculating about her potential wedding dress, let’s look at some of her standout style moments over the years ― from her days as a briefcase girl on “Deal or No Deal” to her royal engagement announcement.  Share this slide:
