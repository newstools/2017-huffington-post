Bloomberg journalist Sam Mkokeli was manhandled by a police officer at the ANC's national conference in Johannesburg on Tuesday. Mkokeli's media accreditation was confiscated in the scuffle. Journalists were made to wait almost an hour for a walkabout with ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa. When Mkokeli complained, the scuffle ensued.  The South African National Editors' Forum is now intervening in the matter. This is a developing story. *An earlier version of this story described the man as a security guard. The article has now been amended.
