Now that the holidays are here, and the season is decidedly summery, there are plenty of outdoor activities you can do with your kids that do not break the bank. 1. People's Theatre Over four productions are staged throughout the course of the year, tailored especially for the young ones, so there's aways something on during school holidays. Tickets are from R70.    2. Sci-bono The interactive science and technology centre in Newtown offers fun and innovative educational experiences that support maths, technonology and science learning. They even run holiday programmes to keep kids busy. R33 will get your child in the door.   3. South African National Museum of Military History There is plenty of military memorabilia, weapons, tanks -- all tracing South Africa's involvement in different wars. It is only R30 per child.
