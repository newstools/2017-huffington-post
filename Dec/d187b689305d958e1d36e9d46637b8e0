What does the man who has everything buy himself for Christmas? Himself, of course. Sylvester Stallone dropped a hefty $400,000 (almost R5-million) on a statue of himself as Rocky from "Rocky III", after anonymously bidding on it at a recent auction. The 2.75m-tall, 820kg statue sold for $403,657 and was shipped to Los Angeles, but it was unclear who actually made the big purchase, TMZ reported â€• until Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger posed for a Christmas photo alongside it in Stallone's house.  "Pec the halls," Stallone captioned the snapshot of the three very beefy men. He also shared a Christmas photo of the daughters he has with wife Jennifer Flavin: Scarlet, Sistine and Sophia. Absent from the snapshot were his sons by ex-wife Sasha Czack, Sage and Seargeoh. This post was originally published on AOL.com.
