Tyrese Gibson has been in South Africa all week, snapping pictures and making us crave a vacation. The singer/actor arrived in the country on Tuesday –– but sorry, ladies: his bae, Samantha Gibson, came along too. The star, familiar from the "Fast And Furious" franchise, has been blessing our Instagram timelines with pictures of his holiday, and we've been hooked.   Tyrese was jet-setting around, and his first pitstop was lunch with struggle stalwart Winnie Madikizela- Mandela. Talk about goals!  He even gave South Africa's former first lady a kiss.  And what would a visit to Mzansi be, without a visit to a game reserve?
