America’s had a rough go of it lately when it comes to Batman, but now filmmakers in Japan are giving the character makeover. Ben Affleck’s portrayal has yielded unenthusiastic critical reviews, but, to be fair, he hasn’t really been given a decent film in which to be Batman. In 2018, a feature length anime film, “Batman Ninja” will hit theaters in Japan, and from the looks of the trailer above, it’s going to be a take on Batman like we’ve never seen before.  Directed by Junpei Mizusaki and with character design by Takashi Okazaki, “Batman Ninja” sees the caped crusader and his enemies sent back in time to Medieval Japan. It’s a genre-splicing iteration of Batman that, at the very least, will be refreshing to watch. Mizusaki says “Batman Ninja” is “how Japan sees Batman and not one about how Batman (and Bruce Wayne) see Japan,” according to io9. Here in America, we’ll take it.
