Luxury shoe brand Jimmy Choo is facing a backlash over its commercial starring Cara Delevingne, which critics call “sexist” and “tone deaf.” Men catcall and shout out “nice shoes, lady” at the actress-model as she walks down a New York City street in the “Shimmer in the Dark” spot. The ad was first released in November, but went viral this week for what people on Twitter called its “regressive” message. Check out the ad here: One tweeter suggested it was “not the best moment to run an ad about how cool and sexy catcalling is,” a reference to sexual misconduct scandals that have engulfed multiple high-profile men in recent weeks. Others expressed surprise at Delevingne’s leading role. The 25-year-old spoke out in October about a disturbing encounter with movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, who multiple women accuse of sexual harassment and assault. Nothing says 'buy me' like harassment. Hard pass. Wow. Tone deaf. Disappointed in Cara for agreeing to be in this campaign if I’m being really honest. I don't view the mood as light. Anytime a man catcalls a women no matter what in he uses to get her attention it's threatening behavior thanks to the society we live in--one thats incredibly violent towards women. For ex, a woman is beaten every 9 seconds in the US. 9 SECONDS! Oh dear @Caradelevingne.  Sad that you took part in this awful, regressive advertisement. I completely disagree with @Caradelevingne and @jimmychoo decision to use #sexualHarassment to sell shoes. #toneDeaf Because women are still just shiny objects... @jimmychoo @Caradelevingne #catcalling ad is tone deaf https://t.co/I4MTdVHt5i via @i_D Hey ladies, buy our shoes! You'll have to beat men off with a stick! No, really! Buy two pairs now and get a Jimmy Choo man-beating stick absolutely free! Perhaps now is not the best moment to run an ad about how cool and sexy catcalling is? https://t.co/8TK9huRHLL Neither Jimmy Choo nor Delevingne have commented on the criticism.
