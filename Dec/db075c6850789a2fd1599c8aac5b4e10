Nine terrorist attacks have been prevented in the UK in the past year, Downing Street has said. MI5 Director General Andrew Parker revealed the figures in a presentation to Theresa May and the Cabinet on Tuesday. Parker told the Prime Minister that the defeat of the so-called Islamic State in Syria did not mean the terrorist threat was over and warned that social media was being utilised to incite attacks from afar. MI5 has previously said that 13 terror attacks were prevented in the past four years, a third of which was helped by public information. Parker released the information ahead of the publication of an investigation into the security services and police following a string of terror attacks in Britain last year amid concerns some of the perpetrators were known to authorities. Attacks at Westminster Bridge - 22 March - Manchester Arena - 22 May- London Bridge - 3 June- and Finsbury Park - 19 June - prompted internal reviews by police and MI5. The attack at Parsons Green, on 15 September, was not covered by the report. This is a breaking news story and will be updated. Check back for the fullest version.
