Some of South Africa's most celebrated artists are documenting their seaside adventures in Durban, and the perspectives they are catching reframe the beauty and unique character of the historic seaside city. LGBTQI+ visual activist Sir Professor Zanele Muholi has returned to her hometown and reveals some sensitive moments of reflection that restore the country's shared memories of the beaches in December.    Desire Marea, one half of performance art musical duo FAKA, also shared some snaps of Durban. We love the pastel colours of the art deco beachfront architecture that he captures so vividly.  Actor, musician and novelist Nakhane is also in Durban for the holidays with his beau, and it looks beautiful.  Enjoy Durban, holidaymakers –– and tag @huffpostsa if you're doing fun things!
