JANUARY -- Cameroon's road to glory begins in Gabon

         African powerhouses Cameroon finally fulfilled their potential as one of Africa's greatest when they beat Egypt to be crowned the 2017 African Nations Cup champions, the tournament officially kicked off in January and would be concluded in early February in the showpiece final in Gabon. Cameroon won their fifth title after defeating seven-time champions Egypt 2-1 in the final with Vincent Aboubakar scoring the winner. The journey for 'The Indomitable Lions' started off in the beginning of the year, finally saw them rewarded in February when they clinched their fifth title. The first in 15 years.  FEBRUARY -- Zlatan Ibrahimovic hands Manchester United the EFL Cup 


                                                                


    
      Prior to his move to the 'Red Devils', Zlatan Ibrahimovic was a world class striker who had won a trophy in every league in which he has played (Netherlands, Italy, Spain and France). There were, however, suggestions among the British media commentariat that he still had to prove himself. And that he did: Zlatan won United's first trophy during the Jose Mourinho era as he scored two goals in the EFL Cup final against Southampton [final score 3-2] to help United regain its spot as the best team in England, and proved to be one of the signings of the season.  MARCH -- Barcelona inspires the greatest comeback in the history of football 


                                                                            


    
      The odds were certainly not in their favour after losing 4-0 in the first leg of their Champions League last 16 knockout games against Paris Saint Germain. Barcelona needed to score six goals in a single game if they were to achieve a reversal of fortunes. It looked impossible, but not for the mighty Barcelona: the side achieved a staggering comeback as they overturned a 4-0 deficit and ended up winning 6-1 on the night and 6-5 after two legs with Sergi Roberto scoring the winning goal in the final seconds of the game.

      Tied at 2-2 after 90 minutes with only seconds to play, Lionel Messi rose to the occasion and scored one of his most celebrated goals against rivals 'Los Blancos'.
