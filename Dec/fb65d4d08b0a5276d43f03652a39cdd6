Johannesburg's Ponte Tower is an icon of the city's skyline and a pop-culture symbol of the city's rise, fall, and resurrection.

         Speaking at the launch of 5101, a new events venue that recently opened on the building's 51st floor, Grosskopff said that the historic Market Theatre in Newtown is by far his best design. Grosskopff also explained how the myths around Ponte's name are wildly exaggerated (there are those who think the name means a bridge between old and new, along with many other exaggerated translations). And he doesn't actually mind when people say the building is "Rodney's big erection".
