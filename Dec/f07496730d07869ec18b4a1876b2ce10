Will Smith was so fresh on the entertainment scene when he was starring in “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” that it’s hard for him to go back and watch the beloved 1990s sitcom.  The actor opened up about what makes the TV series so cringeworthy for him during a recently taped appearance on “The Graham Norton Show.”  “It was my very first role, and I was very, very focused on being successful, so I learned the whole script and everyone else’s lines,” Smith said. “If you watch the first four or five episodes, you can see I’m mouthing other people’s lines. It’s terrible and I can’t bear to watch it.” Smith, 49, also talked about a “Fresh Prince” reunion, telling Norton, “Man, I’d have to be Uncle Phil in that one now ― I’m nearly 50!”  As the internet pointed out earlier this year, Smith looked a whole lot like Uncle Phil (played by the late actor James Avery) in this photo of Smith bungee jumping:  Though it’s not clear if a “Fresh Prince” reunion will be in the works anytime soon, former co-stars Smith and DJ Jazzy Jeff recently had a reunion of their own. The two headlined at Blackpool’s Livewire Festival in August and performed their new single, “Get Lit.” Check it out below:
