There's nothing worse than spending all day driving around a game park without spotting any of the special animals who call these sanctuaries home. But as usual, social media can help. These two social media accounts stay up to date with the latest spottings and events going down in our parks. 1. Kruger Sightings One of the biggest social media sites, with a dedicated following and an active audience. Great for updates while you're in the park itself.  2. Safari Live Join Safari Live for daily live safari news across South Africa and Kenya.
