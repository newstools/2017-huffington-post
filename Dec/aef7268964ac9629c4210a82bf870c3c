For those of us who would like to take a wrecking ball to the work week, the Slow Mo Guys offer a reasonable stand-in. Gavin Free and Daniel Gruchy smashed a bunch of cars with a steel ball that doesn’t care what make or model it touches. They’re all toast. Enjoy the destruction, above. And Happy Friday.
