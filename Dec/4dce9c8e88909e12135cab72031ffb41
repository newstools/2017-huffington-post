Until recently, Taylor Swift has been more secretive about her new boyfriend Joe Alwyn than her political allegiances, so consider us surprised by the couple’s PDA at a weekend concert.  After the “Look What You Made Me Do” singer rocked the Capital FM Jingle Bell Ball in New York (with an assist from Suri Cruise, naturally), she and British actor Alwyn hopped across the pond for the London stop on Swift’s concert tour.  Once Swift was done performing tracks off her new album “Reputation,” she cozied up to Alwyn during Ed Sheeran’s set, because resistance to the ~ feels ~ is clearly futile when “Perfect” comes on.  Instead of watching Sheeran, however, some fans turned their attention to Swift, who was seen arm and arm dancing with Alwyn.  Others claimed to have captured the duo straight-up slow-dancing and kissing during the performance. Obviously, Swifties, who’ve been begging for more info about the couple, lost all semblance of chill on social media. The footage is grainy and taken from a distance, so do with it what you will. But if you squint real hard, you can make out what looks like Swift and Alwyn together.  OH MY GOD THHEU JIST KISSED WHILST ED SANG PERFECT After months of secretly dating, the relationship was confirmed in May. Swift and Alwyn have been seen holding hands and dodging paparazzi together since.  Many of the songs off “Reputation” are rumored to be about Alwyn. Swift sings about a lover’s “ocean blue eyes” and how she’s a certain someone’s “American queen.” Alwyn’s birth year, 1991, is written in graffiti next to Swift’s in the “Ready For It” music video, which also features his name spray-painted in Chinese and English.   Swift was seen shooting scenes for what will likely be her next music video in London in October, reportedly at various spots around town where the couple’s romance began.  Share this slide:
