ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa may be the party's new leader, but its highest decision-making body consists mostly of the same people who served under the party leadership of State President Jacob Zuma. A close analysis of the newly elected list of 80 national executive committee (NEC) members reveals that 44 of them served on the NEC under Zuma between 2012 and 2017. That means that 55 percent of the previous NEC was reelected at the party's national conference earlier this week.  And there certainly are some rotten apples on the list. For instance: In a recent statement, the DA said the "unashamed" inclusion of such names in the new NEC shows that the ANC's promises of self-correction "were a myth".  "[Ramaphosa] built his campaign on the idea that cutting the head off the snake will kill it, but instead the snake has simply shed its skin," the party said. Perhaps the DA has a point –– Zuma still has a tight grasp on the party. READ: Zuma's Grip On The ANC Still Tight As A Vice. Thirty-six of the newly elected NEC officials were from the Dlamini-Zuma slate (which can be argued to be the Zuma slate as well). Ramaphosa only secured 29. Seven members appeared on both slates ahead of the election, and eight appeared on neither. It's a mixed batch of members, divided between provinces that supported Ramaphosa and those that were backing Dlamini-Zuma. Majority always wins in the NEC, and Ramaphosa is on the back foot, because Zuma's allies have the numbers. The support for the state president in the NEC is strong –– he has kept many of its members out of trouble. Ramaphosa has his work cut out for him –– he promised an ANC without corruption; one that oozes good governance and credibility. But his NEC is a contradiction. And opposition parties won't let him forget it. The battle for 2019 begins.
