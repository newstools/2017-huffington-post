Model Chrissy Teigen and her husband, singer John Legend, were on a flight from Los Angeles to Tokyo on Tuesday when the plane suddenly turned around and headed back to the states. Turns out a fellow passenger on All Nippon Airways Flight 175 had boarded the wrong plane. After taking off at 11:36 a.m. PT, the plane returned to Los Angeles International Airport at 7:33 p.m. PT, CNN reported. All Nippon flight attendants told Teigen the displaced passenger had a United Airlines boarding pass.  As Teigen’s flight saga continued, she kept her Twitter followers updated. According to the model, the plane was taken to a secure area of the LAX runway. The airplane and its 226 passengers returned to Los Angeles in accordance with All Nippon’s security protocol, CNN later reported. In a statement provided the outlet, the airline said it was investigating the incident. Teigen said authorities questioned certain passengers before allowing them to deplane. Eventually, Teigen and Legend deplaned and went to an airline lounge. While waiting, Teigen took solace in an episode of “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” and ate a bowl of ramen.

Teigen and Legend boarded another flight to Tokyo hours after their originally scheduled takeoff. Getting on another flight now oh bless Taking off!!!
