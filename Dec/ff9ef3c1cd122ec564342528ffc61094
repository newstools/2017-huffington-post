South Africa-born comedian Trevor Noah's response to being called a "Hollywood elitist" is being hailed as the biggest Twitter clapback in history.  A U.S. Twitter user's assumption that Noah was from America wasn't going to fly with Noah, who hosts The Daily Show, so he quickly reminded the follower about his African roots. He wrote: "I'm from Soweto not Hollywood."  It saw a flood of fresh support for the comedian, a national treasure in his hometown.    Stay slaying, Mr Noah!
