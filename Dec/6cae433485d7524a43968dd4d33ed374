It's been quite a year. And Google's stirring review of 2017 will make you laugh, cry and experience pretty much every emotion in between: The online search engine's two-minute video, released Wednesday, highlights what people have been looking up over the last 12 months. The clip focuses on one term â€• "How." Such as: * How much will the wall cost * How to board up a window * How to run for office Some of the search terms were related to Donald Trump's presidency, but many showed people's humanity as they asked how they could help hurricane victims, refugees and others in times of need.
