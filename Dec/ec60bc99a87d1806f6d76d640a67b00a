Chrissy Teigen is sick of people leaking personal details about her life to media outlets.  She tweeted out her frustration on Tuesday after seeing an E! News article about her pregnancy cravings.  The article cites a source who says that Teigen’s cravings are “out of control” and that she’s craving “cheeseburgers, French fries, chips and anything fried or spicy” ― which any real fan of the model and cookbook author would already know. Teigen wasn’t happy with the so-called friend who revealed this, and asked E! to identify the source. She said it would be helpful for other celebs, too:  Some of Teigen’s Twitter followers offered up the same solution to catch the informant:  Tell each one of your "friends" something different. When a story leaks, you can find out who leaked it based on which story you told that person. Tell all your friends something different and lightly scandalous (and fake) and see which one gets sold to E! news. 👀 You better Tyrion Lannister these “friends” and tell them all different stuff and see what leaks Unfortunately, Teigen says that plan would never work because of one minor problem: I cannot lie without laughing. I’m a very obvious liar https://t.co/rF9WATXtLv Teigen ― who’s expecting her second child with husband John Legend ― should try copying what friends Kanye West and Kim Kardashian reportedly did when their daughter, North, was born. According to a TMZ report, Kardashian figured someone would try to sell a photo of their newborn baby, so she sent out fake photos to a few different friends. TMZ said it received two different photos from sources claiming the baby was North West (it wasn’t).  The baby picture plan has also been effective for other celebrities. A few years ago, actor Ryan Reynolds caught a lifelong friend of his trying to sell a photo of his child.  Reynolds told GQ that finding out his friend was the one shopping the picture “was like a death. It was one of those devastating things to find out.” “I don’t think he thought he would ever be caught,” the actor added. Let’s see if Teigen catches anyone.
