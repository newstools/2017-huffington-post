The royal family has just presented J.K. Rowling with a Companion of Honor award at Buckingham Palace. The “Harry Potter” author received the prestigious award from Prince William on Tuesday, as recognition of her services to literature and philanthropy. "To be included in the distinguished and diversely talented company of the other Companions of Honour, especially as a female writer, is a particular privilege." Congratulations to @jk_rowling who today became a Companion of Honour for her services to literature & philanthropy. pic.twitter.com/d1W35JYTBz According to the royal family, King George V founded the Order of the Companions of Honor in 1917, and the queen names recipients of the award “who have made a major contribution in their field.”  Rowling said in a statement that she was “deeply honored and proud” to receive the honor. “To be included in the distinguished and diversely talented company of the other Companions of Honour, especially as a female writer, is a particular privilege,” she said. CORRECTION: A previous version of this story indicated Prince William had named J.K. Rowling a Royal Companion of Honor. In fact, the queen conferred the title of honor on Rowling this summer, and Prince William presented it Tuesday.
