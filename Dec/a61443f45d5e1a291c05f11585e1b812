Concerned Alumni Media Statement 20 December 2017 As alumni of the University Still Known as Rhodes (USKAR), we express our concern and dismay at the university's recent decision to permanently expel two students. It is not merely the expulsion, but the severity of this action that alarms us -- namely, that the students stand to lose the credits they have earned while at the university, and will be denied the opportunity to complete their degrees. Context of the Expulsions In April 2016, the #RUReferenceList was released anonymously via social media, outing alleged perpetrators of sexual assault who were either students at USKAR at the time, or past students who had since graduated. Hundreds mobilised to demonstrate across campus, with a group of students "taking custody" of two of the accused. On 17 November 2017, the university permanently expelled two students -- Yolanda Dyanti and Dominique McFall -- for "criminal acts" allegedly committed during these protests. According to the Mail & Guardian, which has seen the university's internal documents, USKAR has argued that to expel the students with "untainted" transcripts would allow them to complete their degrees elsewhere: "a result [that] would render this entire disciplinary process a wasted exercise". Thus, the students' transcripts will read "Conduct unsatisfactory" and list a range of offences, including kidnapping, defamation, assault and insubordination (with some variation between the two students in question). This is highly unusual, as official transcripts do not typically record disciplinary offences. Furthermore, USKAR will not accept credits obtained from other institutions towards completing their degrees. These two actions make it impossible for Dyanti and McFall to obtain their degrees, essentially robbing them of the education they have worked for over the past three years. Concerned Alumni Speak Out We understand that universities must have disciplinary structures in place to deal with criminal behaviour. USKAR maintains that Dyanti and McFall are being expelled for "illegal acts" and not for protesting, which is a constitutional right in South Africa. However, in line with the statement released by concerned academics at USKAR, we must question "whether the university actually had the prima facie evidence against these students for the alleged acts -- particularly when one of these students was unable to be present at the hearings." Furthermore, it perturbs us that, in disciplining the students, the university has departed so drastically from the guidelines set by the South African justice system. As Candice Nolan reports for the SABC: "According to the university website, a student found guilty of rape was once given a ten-year exclusion –– a crime that carries a direct imprisonment term in our justice system. But absurdly, had the activists been tried in a court of law, they may only have faced a four-year suspended sentence." USKAR brands itself as an institution "where leaders learn." But what exactly, we ask, will students learn in light of this draconian action? Thanks to the remarkable scholarship and guidance of our academic staff, many of us hold dear the years we spent at the university. USKAR is where we learnt to think critically and compassionately, to challenge power and status quo, and to imagine a better and more inclusive future for our country and the world. By meting out such an extreme punishment, we worry that the message sent to students and staff alike is that dissent will not be tolerated at the university, and that protest must comply with the "acceptable" standards delineated by those in power. How can academics, both nascent and established, practise critical scholarship when they fear retribution for speaking out against social and institutional justice? This is not simply about the alleged criminality of Dyanti and McFall, but also the larger implications for higher education and the pursuit of knowledge. As alumni, our intention is not to weigh in on the criminality of the alleged perpetrators or student activists. But we cannot stand by and see our alma mater quash the radical, critical potential of students and staff by denying degrees, retroactively erasing academic work, and preventing further education. We call upon the university to live up to its motto: to lead, and to teach others to lead, in the fight for academic freedom, transformation, and social justice.
