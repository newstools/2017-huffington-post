I thought they complemented each other—until I experienced both and discovered that they can’t coexist. There are too many people who are convinced that they’re in love with someone just because they’re amazing and they can’t stop thinking about them, but the truth is most of the time the intensity that comes with really liking someone is not love — it’s infatuation.
