The historic picture of a dying Hector Pieterson in the 1976 Soweto uprising was revived and desecrated in an invitation allegedly crafted by members of Selborne College in East London. The image which was used in an invitation to matriculants for a reunion at the school's Old Boys Club and has been widely circulated on social media. The Old Selbornian Association has distanced itself from the image, IOL reported.  Alan Parsons, executive director of the Old Selbornian Association, denied the invitation had been a formal one issued by the association.  He said the poster had been sent out as part of a social event planned for matric pupils following the end of their end of their exams and was not authorised or sent by him.  IOL reported that Parsons had requested time to provide a detailed response to the alleged invitation, but had yet to do so at the time of publishing on Friday.  This picture has caused public outrage with many sharing their disappointment and anger over the image.
