The women of “Saturday Night Live” hit back at the widespread news of sexual harassment allegations with a “Welcome to Hell” skit to remind us that none of these allegations ― as shocking as they may be ― is actually anything new. “Hey there, boys, we know the last couple months have been insane,” Cecily Strong says while referring to the reports of rape, harassment and other misconduct against high-profile men since the Harvey Weinstein scandal broke. “All of these big, cool, powerful guys are turning out to be, what’s the word, habitual predators,” Aidy Bryant adds. “And it’s like, dang, is this the world now?” That’s when Strong breaks the news to anyone still living under a rock: “This been the damn world.” Despite the whimsical Katy Perry look, with floating cherries, clouds and giant lollipops, the video didn’t sugarcoat the growing list of issues women face ― and have faced for centuries. Flashbacks included scenes of women’s suffrage, witch burning and a male-dominated workplace reminiscent of the TV show “Mad Men.” Leslie Jones also stepped in to remind everyone that “it’s like a million times worse for a woman of color.” “Now ‘House of Cards’ is ruined, and that really sucks. Well here’s a list of stuff that’s ruined for us,” actress Saoirse Ronan says before they tick through a list that includes parking, walking, Uber, ponytails, bathrobes, nighttime, drinking, hotels and vans. Viewers quickly took to social media to applaud the women’s work, with several calling it the anthem we need right now.
